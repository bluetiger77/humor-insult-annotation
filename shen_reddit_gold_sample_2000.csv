cat9uha,"For one, if you're using ""Nature's Miracle"" to clean stains, dump it.  The best thing I found to keep my dog from coming back to sniff on locations where she had had accidents during her potty-training phase was OxyClean.  You have to rinse really well (especially if your guy is a furniture/carpet licker, like mine), but it seems to do a better job of eliminating scent.

Also - is it more marking than actual voiding? Marking tends to be small little puddles, and against corners and furniture - he's marking his territory.  Relieving himself is large soaking puddles.  There would be a difference in training.  (Also worth noting - is he fixed yet?  That can help with this type of behaviour.)

Otherwise, I don't know what to tell you.  You will have to keep a strict eye on him - if he starts to look like he's going to go (I'm sure you know his signs), drag his fuzzy butt outside.  Or - as much as I hate to say it - you may have to crate him more often.

Final Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31hbbb/my_daughters_new_friend_final_update/



My daughter Harmony is a gentle soul.  She really lives up to her name. She loves people, all people, from all walks of life-so much so that she randomly brings home strangers and befriends them.  I have spoken with her about this, about how dangerous her actions are.  She trusts too much.  Once, she brought home a homeless girl her age.  Her name was Rebel, and she had run away from home just weeks prior.  We fed her, let her take a hot shower, and gave her some of Harmony's clothes that she had outgrown (Harmony is a little on the chubbier side).  We eventually talked Rebel into going back home to her parents, who accepted her with open arms.  It was a teary reunion, and Harmony couldn't have asked for a better outcome.

However, Harmony's newest bff didn't sit well with me.  She was a new girl in school, Layla was her name.  I had an uneasy feeling about Layla ever since Harmony brought her home with her from school one day.  I came in from work, around 5pm, and found my daughter and her new friend sitting in the living room watching tv.  Her appearance startled me.  She was very pale and thin, with jet black hair and piercing blue eyes.  Those eyes seemed to cut right through me when they were cast upon me.  I immediately felt uncomfortable.  She didn't smile, even when Harmony introduced us.  She simply gave me a slight nod, then turned her attention back to the television.  Harmony explained to me that Layla didn't speak much.  The kids in her class were giving her a hard time, so my daughter, being the saint that she is, stepped in and took her under her wing.

Layla found herself sleeping at my house at least 4 nights a week.  When I voiced my concerns to Harmony about this, she explained to me that Layla's dad drank a lot and she'd prefer not to be around him. Her mom gave all of her attention to her twin siblings, and acted as if Layla didn't even exist.  She also explained to me that if Layla didn't sleep at our home, she would sleep in an abandoned house a block over from her home just to avoid her family.  I agreed to lay off, since it was winter time and the temperatures had been below freezing. But eventually, I was going to have to have a talk with her parents.

I also noticed that Layla didn't seem to eat.  Well, at least I had never witnessed her eat, until one night that is.  I was throwing some steaks on the grill.  I offered, I figured in vein, to throw one on for Layla.  Surprisingly, she accepted.  Even Harmony looked surprised.  She indicated, however, that she prefers her steak EXTRA RARE.  This basically means, just toss it on the grill and leave it on maybe 30 seconds on each side, at least by Layla's standards.  I became sick as I watched her down that slab of bloody meat, being sure that she didn't leave one drop of blood on the plate.  Harmony and I glanced at each other several times, looks of disgust and intrigue on our faces.  I guess I should have just been happy to see her eat something.

Things started happening that made me more and more uneasy about this girl.  I'm a very light sleeper.  The tiniest sound will make me from my slumber.  There were a few nights where I would wake up abruptly, not really sure what woke me up.  It was a habit for me to check in on Harmony whenever I experienced these occurrences, just to be sure that she was ok.  Well, the first night I made my way to Harmony's room, where Layla also slept, on a futon that folded out into a bed. I was startled by the temperature in the room.  It was a bitter cold winter night, and the temperature in the room matched the outside temperature.  Harmony was still sleeping, but Layla was not there.  I quickly closed the window, threw an extra blanket over Harmony, then went around the house looking for Layla.  I found her sitting in the living room, in the dark, just staring at the tv, which was off.  I called her name, but she didn't answer.  I asked her if she had had a bad dream, and she nodded her head, still looking at the blank tv screen.  I told her to try to go back to bed and get some sleep, since school was in a few hours.  She quietly got up and headed back to Harmony's room, without saying a word.

I mentioned this to Harmony the next day, and she just brushed it off, saying that it's no surprise that she has bad dreams, taking into consideration what she's been dealing with regarding her family issues.  But the next 2 nights, the exact same thing happened.  I was woken up out of my sleep, head to Harmony's room, window opened, no Layla.  Again, I found her in the living room in the dark.  I left her there the last 2 times, not really knowing what was really going on with this poor girl.

It had come to the point where Layla was pretty much living with us.  I made the decision to speak with her parents.  I mean, what kind of parents were they to not even show any kind of concern as to where their child was sleeping at night or even if she was ok or not?  Getting the information out of Layla as far as her address, or at least a phone number to contact her parents, proved to be very difficult.  She would just nonchalantly ignore me and walk out of the room.  Harmony begged me to just leave it alone, and let her deal with it.  My daughter had never even met her parents or even been to her home.

Well, one day, everything came to a head.  The police showed up at my door early one Saturday morning.  I was surprised to see them, especially since it was 6am.  They asked me if I knew Layla.  I hesitantly answered, then invited them in out of the cold.

""What's this about officers?""  I asked, looking back and forth between the two men standing before me.
""Have a seat, please Ms. Wittman.  You're going to want to be sitting down for this,"" one of the officers said.  We all sat.
""Do you need me to go get Layla?  She's been staying here with me and my daughter for the past few weeks.  She's been having some troubles at home with her parents.  She and my daughter became friends at school."" 
The officers gave each other a glance, then looked back at me.  This time, the other officer spoke.

""Ms. Wittman, Layla is in police custody at this time.  She has been since about 2 hours ago.""
A look of surprise and concern took over my tired face.
""What?  That can't be!""
Just then, Harmony comes out, looking at the officers with confusion on her face.
""Mom, what's going on?  Why are they here?  Where's Layla?""
""I don't know sweet heart.  That's what I'm trying to find out.""  I said, looking back at the officers.
""Um, I'm not sure if she should hear this,"" one of the officers said, gesturing towards Harmony.
""I'm 17, I'm not a child.  I wanna hear it.  Does it have something to do with Layla?""
The officers looked to me for approval, and I gave them the ""go ahead"".  The story that they told us is something that I will never forget.

Apparently, Layla was accused of butchering her entire family.  She did this over the course of a week.  She would sneak out of Harmony's window, taking advantage of the fact that Harmony, unlike me, was a hard sleeper. She slipped into her home in the wee hours of the morning, when she knew that her family would be sleeping, and butchered her mom, dad, and her 3 year old twin sisters, in their sleep.  The twins, she took a knife and slit their throats so deep, that they were nearly decapitated.  Her mom, she also slit her throat, then stabbed her over 40 times all over her body.  The worst was her dad, whom had apparently passed out, drunk, on the couch, and slept through it all.  She had tied him up with electrical cords and shoved a rag into his mouth.  She tortured him for 5 days, before she finally ended his life by taking a knife and slitting him open from just below his throat to just above his groin.  And here's the worst part.  The morning that the police arrived at my home, they had found Layla in the house, after her dad's job had called and reported that  he hadn't shown up for work for a few days and wasn't answering his phone, blood and gore covering her hands, mouth and face.  When the police entered the home, after finding a spare key under a fake rock next to the door, Layla nonchalantly looked at them, guts hanging from her mouth, then continued to munch on her father's innards, as if they weren't there.  Almost everyone that witnessed this began to throw up, making the scene even more unsettling.  It finally took 3 officers to pull Layla away from her dad, then they searched the home and found the remains of her mom and siblings.

Later, they found a journal of Layla's.  The things they read in the journal were very disturbing.  The one entry that stood out to me most was this one, that the police, after practically having to beg them, finally gave me a copy of.  It read:

This is it.  I'm finally going to go through with it.  These people don't deserve to live any longer.  I didn't ask to be adopted.  It's not my fault that my real mom and dad took one look at me and decided that they didn't want to be burdened with the responsibility of a life besides their own.  The twins probably don't deserve to die, but if I let them live, they'll be orphans, just like I was, and no one needs that.  They don't want to end up like me.  My ""mom"" never wanted me anyway.  And my ""dad"", well, I guess he just needed some fresh young meat to pound on.  This is going to be my final entry.  By the time anyone reads this, they will all be dead, and I will have satisfied a craving that I've had for so long, but never got a chance to indulge until now.  I crave human flesh, I always have ever since I can remember.  Maybe they knew something was different about me. I don't know.  I'm so excited that I'll finally get the chance to see what human flesh actually tastes like.  I've waited for so long.  This is it.  I don't know what will happen to me from here, but I promise this won't be my last human meal.

Previous Giveaway Description:

So when I was a kid, my parents were pretty poor, and couldn't afford ANY game systems at all. Some of my friends had Nintendo game systems, and I wanted one SO insanely badly, but the money just wasn't there, ever. I was sooooo drawn to video gaming and thought it was magical, I wanted to just have even one Nintendo game, but wasn't able to get any video game system until late in my teens. I used to actually watch the Super Mario Brothers cartoon whenever it was on, as that was the closest I could come as a kid to playing the game. Obviously I was grateful for the things I did have when I was a kid, like food, water, shelter, etc. But still, always bummed me out a bit that we couldn't afford a Nintendo. ANYWAY, now am in an ironically different position, and have a totally FREE BRAND NEW Diablo 3 EXPANSION PACK game to give to someone, please let me know how it would help you out. I feel is fair to pay things forward when you are in a position to help people!

My brothers learned how to cook and sew. The camp outs  included real tents and cool activities. I felt almost punished for being a girl. ","Same!

dozq2rz,"Hi Guys,

I help a promoter run a night every month at a bar using some rented gear. The deal is the venue’s PA’s is theirs and we can use their instruments, amps, cables etc. but most of it is falling apart, so me and the promoter worked out a deal to rent cables, mics and the mixer from a mutual friend.  

For the last few months or so, we’ve been getting more electric guitar based acts (normally it’s acoustic with DIs, but recently there are more guitars with amps) and for the last two months, we have been getting a problem with the musician getting a sharp electric shock through their mic to their lips when they are holding their guitar, this month it happened with two musicians; a bass guitar and the guitarist. This really threw us off and we ended up having to run the show late, with the guitarist’s rig and the bass guitar running through DI, which resulted in no shock. 

I did some research, and I know what you’re all thinking. Grounding in the guitar amps, or bad wiring in the mains sockets. Thing is, I’ve been told that it doesn’t happen when the venue uses their own mixer (we don’t use it because it doesn’t have enough channels), and also they have just changed their bass amp for a new, hartke one. But what I do know is that the mixer we use uses a two prong power supply instead of a three prong, and we use a travel adapter to plug it into a three prong socket (we are in HK, so our plugs are three prong UK style sockets, but the mixer’s power supply is a China-style two prong with no earth). So, I came to the conclusion that AC current was leaking from the mixer’s power supply, through the mixer, into the mic cable’s ground, through the mic and attempting to be earthed into whatever was nearest, in this case wet lips and an earthed guitar (through the guitar amp). This might have explained why DI’ing the guitars didn't give the musicians a shock, as there would be no circuit completion from the guitar amp to the mixer. 

Not wanting potentially dead musicians on my hands, after the night I told the promoter that I’ll refuse to use this mixer until our friend can replace the power supply with a three prong supply with proper earth and explained the situation to them.

I want to get some feedback from you guys:

1. Do you think I came to the right conclusion? Apparently, the PA is on the same ground loop as well, but I am unsure of that. Nevertheless, I told the venue owner to make sure his sockets are wired correctly. 
2. Do you think I overreacted? I want to keep this monthly thing going as it’s good experience, but at the end of the day the gear isn’t mine. 
3. I read that this is life threatening, which is why I told the promoter that I’d refuse to use the mixer. Do you think I made the right choice?","On my stage, our vocalists used to get little zaps from their mics and after a while my old boss narrowed it down to possibly static. So he came in one day with some anti-static fabric spray and lightly sprayed it all around where our vocalists stood (carpeted stage) and that fixed the problem for about a week until he sprayed again.

dn0z2vt,"In my relationship, we met while smoking, smoked together for years, and all of his friends are stoners. He's known these guys since he was a kid and they've always been close, but nowadays all they do is get together and smoke. He was born in a small town outside of the city and it's about a 20 minute drive for his friends to come over here to hang out with him, or vice versa. 

Ever since he and I quit smoking.. his friends don't talk to him. They don't make the effort to come and see him and they don't hit him up to invite him out with them, as all they do is smoke together and play video games. So, instead of making that effort anymore, they'd rather just play on team speak and be at their houses and get stoned like they want to, instead of coming over here to hang out. I feel like it's my fault as I have caused some drama early on while trying to quit because he would smoke with them or was tempted to, but would then turn around and make empty promises to me about quitting and bettering himself and growing up, etc.. then just go smoke anyway. It almost tore us apart.

But, at some point, he quit cold turkey. He is on day 8 and I am on day 13. We've ridden this rollercoaster of quitting and relapsing and fighting about it and repeat.

I am on the side that says if this is how his friends want to spend their time and they won't make the effort to spend any time with him that they aren't quality friends. He says they just don't bother hitting him up anymore because it's easier to hang out with other stoners and I can tell it really hurts him. We both struggle with anxiety and depression, and that makes this all that much more difficult.. 

Today, we had a long talk about how his friends have been kind of shutting him out and he feels like he is losing all of his friends and he broke down in tears and left the room, asking to be alone. I left him alone, and time passed and we have returned to normal. But, he didn't follow up or tell me what he was really feeling and seeing him break down crushed me, with feelings of guilt and doubt and made me feel like I made him choose between me and his friends. I am sure he resents me for it but he won't talk to me about it and now I'm afraid to bring it up.

Has anyone gone through losing their friends to this journey and not been okay with it? How did you deal? I feel like our lives are pulling us in different directions but he keeps insisting that he wants to try to make it work and I don't know how I feel anymore..","People that only want to hang out with you if you smoke too aren't real friends.

When I started working out, my boyfriend (now ex) wasn't very into it.. He even made some comments showing me photos of women with big guns and said ""don't get like that"". I think part of the reason he acted like this was insecurity because he wasn't very muscular and didnt want a girlfriend stronger than him. It started to become a turn off that he had no desire to work out with me and get healthier. He had weights but never used them. The even more annoying part was that he was naturally thin, and he acted like he was somehow better than me because I wasn't. This is part of what led to our break up. It made me realize that i require a partner who is at least verbally supportive of my fitness.. Even better if he joins me and we can exercise together.

Do you enter competitions or is this a hobby?  You don't have to stop riding but this isn't a valid career path for 99.9% of people.

&gt; am a very avid photographer.

Photography is a brutal field to monitise. You can, but the competition and life as a ""starving artist"" isn't as glamorous as it seems.  Photography should be more of a hobby or a supplement to a career, not a career.

In other words:

* How do you turn your interests into a career?

* What work is entailed in growing that career and becoming one of the ""best"" in your area at what you do?  Are you willing to put that work in?

* Will you be happy with that career for the next 20 years?

* will college give you any tools to enhance or improve those jobs? Even if it's just general business classes?

I know Im not the funniest or the most interesting, so it means a lot that you can see something about me that inspires you. This past year has been very hard for me in a lot of ways. alot of people I think have made a lot of assumptions about who I am off camera and I don't confirm or deny anything because I think actions speak louder than words... But I guess sometimes that's not the case, and maybe silence on certain things gives off the wrong impression.

I see more often than not that people see me as a ""businessman"" which makes me, really, really sad. 2014 was a very hard year for me because I was forced to focus on managing Game Grumps. Being that I'm not a businessman, doing businessy things takes a lot of time and energy out of me, and it put me in a really shitty place. If there was a reason I neglected artistic works during that year, it's because I was drained of my creative energy by having to deal with stuff I HAD to deal with in order to provide a fulfilling job for my friends. I didn't want to be in charge of Grumps, but it's something that SOMEONE had to do, and I took responsibility for it.  I made a lot of sacrifices to allow everyone at Grumps to feel like they can pursue their own artistic projects with the free time their involvement with grumps allows. Meanwhile, my own artistic endeavors suffered because I was too busy making sure everyone else was in a good place. There are some things I failed at, but I did my best, and I'm still trying to.

I just don't like talking about this kind of stuff because it seems like I'm talking myself up, and it's also really dumb and businessy and this is an Internet show talking over video games.

dql0v4k,"Recent conversations with family and friends on having kids have had me a bit peeved and in need of an outlet to vent lol. I'm a lady in my early twenties and I have no desire to have kids. BUT, one of the major reasons why I don't want them lies in the fact that I don't want my body undergoing all of the horrendous shit that comes with pregnancy. Prolapsed uteruses, combined pussy and assholes, bladders that don't work, ripped abdominal muscles, stomachs that look like pudding, droopy tits etc. The flowery pictorials of ""mommy bodies"" and phrases like tiger stripes make me cringe. I understand just how awful pregnancy can be from observing the experiences of my siblings firsthand, and seeing the hidden truth of how horrible these changes are. 

I know that this makes me sound like an absolutely awful person and incredibly vain. But what is wrong with being a little vain? I've had issues with an eating disorder in the past and I feel like as a woman I already deal with a lot of pressure to keep up a certain appearance. I invest a lot of time and money into my body, what with exercising, healthy eating, advanced skincare, makeup and fashion, pricey hairdos and hair products. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all of these things and I love being creative with my body and take pride in taking great care of myself. I just want to know if anyone else feels strongly about not having kids for similar reasons. 

I value my health and my sleep and my ""me time"", and the fact that I have the ability to just be selfish whenever I feel like it. Is it really all that evil of me to not want to sacrifice my body? This isn't the only reason I'm not interested in kids obviously, but it's a major one. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would abort if I became pregnant in any circumstance. I won't date men that aren't down with that, but even in the future if I was married and became pregnant I would be heavily tempted to not even tell my husband about my abortion just to avoid being looked at as a monster.

Update: So she decided to go to the doctor. Her appointment is for tuesday afternoon. I can't make it to her appointment so I'm worried she won't have the gall to communicate with her Dr because she gets timid.

Last night was a huge arguement, after a week of no sex and her stringing me along 2 days it finally came to a fight and she said she wanted to break up because we always fight every few days because she said ""I don't want to have sex, like ever, its too much work. She just doesn't get urges. 

After talking she decided we'd stay together but now I'm not to complain or start arguements. So essentially we are having sex once a week for the rest of the relationship or she'll break up with me again eventually. It sucks because I love her and can't picture never being with her anymore, but at the same time I want to have sex with her and her rejecting or not desiring me makes me feel not as loved, and bitter towards her. 

Is the culprit really her birth control or is her sex drive just low naturally and she doesn't want sex ever. What should I tell her to ask the doctor. I plan to coach her through this because if I don't she won't know what to ask. I just want her to want sex with me, I don't want to be with anyone else.

cd2qs6n,"Ok, so I have actually been where this guy is. I'm 27 right now, and just got married. I've been with my (now) wife for 9 years. When I was 4 years into the relationship, I was most certainly *not* certain about marriage. For the exact same reasons as your boyfriend, I was fearful about the rate of divorce coupled with the system being weighted against men. What I was sure of however was that I still wanted to be with her, and that my feelings for her had not changed. I didn't have doubt, but I did have fear. I have fairly bad issues with anxiety of future probabilities, my brain tends to over-focus on possibilities.

Now, had she essentially forced my hand, we may not be together. We may, but I just don't think I was ready for that kind of commitment. It took me a few more years, but we had moved in together and basically been living a married life for several years. I actually planned the proposal a good while before I made it, because of some circumstances, but the point is, we've been partners for almost 10 years, even though we have only been ""married"" for 9 days.

Essentially, there is only two things I can think of that you will be missing by not being married, aside from a ring and a piece of paper. That is power of attourney and a few similar things. You can be given those things however. He can have it officially certified that were it necessary, you would be allowed to represent him in say medical decisions. He can write you into a will. You can co-own everything.

The other thing is joint filing on taxes, but that's probably not that big of a deal for you guys, and would be fine to live without too. My personal advice is simply to go on living as if you were married, show him that getting married isn't needed to have a perfect relationship. 

Ultimately, the significance of marriage can only be decided by you.

“People who see us from the outside think that our greatest struggle is the disability. It’s not. Our greatest struggle is that we’d fallen out of love with each other. I lost a lot of my independence when Tatiana was born. I fell into a depression. He was working a lot. We grew distant. I didn’t think I could ever love him again. Two years ago I prayed one night, and said: ‘God, you’ve done so much. Please grant me one more miracle and make me love him again.’ 

**The first change came from me.** He’s always been the easygoing one, so I had to change first. I started trusting more. I tried to be more forgiving and understanding. I started to cook for him and organize things around the house. And he started spending more time at home. We started enjoying each other’s company. We talked about things other than diseases. And we started going out together– just like this. **It was like I suddenly met a friend, who became my best friend, who became my love.** And our life started over again.” (São Paulo, Brazil)","If more people were able to realize this, the number of divorces would greatly reduce :) Extremely sweet and moving story, OP",,,

It's difficult to objectively say whether or  not I'm better than I was in the relationship.  It was nowhere near perfect, but unfortunately the mindset that infidelity creates makes it close to impossible for me to remember any of the good times, let alone fondly.  It's all kind of covered in this dark mist.  Everything is tainted, in a way.  

Every good memory is tainted, I could look back at a memory from before his affair started (and before he kissed her that one time WAY before his affair actually started - the one time he was open, honest, forthcoming, and confessed anything and I forgave him INSTANTLY because I believe it was the **one** time he was truly sincere and sorry) and even those have the sense of the OW injected into them.

d09wntq,"As for general guidelines:

* T3/T4 is really easy, just a potato'ed, not forma'ed, strong weapon is enough (even unpotato'ed tonkor works), you don't even need to potato your frame probably, although it helps (build tanky first and let your weapon do the job).
* Sorties (specially the 3rd map), is a lot harder than T4, your weapons and frame must be maxed with potato, forma and proper modding
* You need a good pool of weapons just in case of weapons restrictions.
* You need a good selection of frames for different map types (for example: Trin is always useful, Nova/Frost for defense, Inviframe for Spy, Tankframe for Survival, Mag vs Corpus, etc)
* Check the mission type, conditions, enemy faction, and pick your frame trying to synergize with your allies as much as possible (and avoid repeated frames)
* IMO, bringing utility and CC to the team is better than just raw damage (anyone with a maxed strong weapon can do that).
* Change weapon elements to the strongest against the enemy faction.
* BTW, since you are probably new to the game, don't bother to max R10 mods for now, from R8 to R10 cost hundred of rare cores, so I'd recommend you to set R8 as your soft cap for now.

Finally, my weapon recommendation: get Sonicor

(talking from experience, since it was the first weapon I maxed, I used it a lot since I was a newb)

It will carry you long time, the weapon has a great fire rate, mag, AoE, CC, ammo eff, may not have the best damage, but that doesn't matter, it's extremely versatile, useful in all mission types. Really good for speed farming runs because of mag size, fire rate and AoE. Ohh, and extremely fun with Blast elemental damage, you'll see enemies fly all over the map.

Max it (potato and forma) and laugh hard at all the content up to T3/T4 including endless up to 40 waves/mins and maybe a bit more. Still works even in Sorties 3 (you may struggle a bit with damage in the last mins in endless maps, but they still ragdoll / status).","Thanks for the help! I'll make sure to grab myself a Frost and a Sonicor. I *have* been trying to get my mods to R10, but I guess R8 would be the better choice for now, as I'm not swimming in cores.

Again, thanks for the advice. :D",,,

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. ",It's really tough nowadays.

czuxdf0,"I don't think that the delegate allocation rules have been posted yet and the primary is around the corner so I was doing some research and I found a delegate calculator by a Bernie supporter online on this website. http://www.politicalrevolutionusa.us/

I am not an American and don't know anything about primaries but after playing around with the numbers and doing some online research, I found this:

New Hampshire has two Congressional districts, NH1 covering the southeastern part of New Hamphire and consisting of: Greater Manchester, the Seacoast and the Lakes Region. The second is NH2 consisting of northern and western parts including Nashua (second-largest city) as well as Concord (state capital).

**Now the important part**
Each district has 8 delegates allocated to it and Sanders needs to win by ~57% to get a delegate edge 5 vs 3 for Hillary. Hillary knows this and is trying to cut the lead to 5-6% so that even if we end up winning the popular vote, that by itself may not mean a lot as the delegates will be awarded 4-4. If we can win by by 69%, then we get a 6-2 distribution of delegates and get to crush Hillary.

**Bottom line:**
Vote vs Delegates (out of 8)
| &lt;15% - 0 |
15-18% - 1 |
19-31% - 2 |
32-43% - 3 |
44-56% - 4 |
57-68% - 5 |
69-81% - 6 |
82-85% - 7 |
86% - 8 (IMO, our goal thus making Clinton non viable)

Apart from this, NH also has 5 ""at-large"" (proportional to state vote) and ""3"" PLEO (Party Leaders and Elected Official) delegates for a total of 24 from this state.

Someone more familiar with NH Primary can  hopefully fact check me.

** EDIT ** : For more information and better clarity, there is already an article about it online (link provided by /u/HvBoedefeld)
http://m.dailykos.com/stories/2016/2/3/1479118/-New-Hampshire-Delegate-Mathematics



","Quick question, for someone who is better at thinking than I:  If we won New Hampshire, how come Clinton has more delegates, such as shown on http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/primaries/2016-02-09#NH-Dem",,,
dmra7n0,"Maybe. Only a small portion of NASA's work is classified (confidential, secret, etc.), but that doesn't solve OP's problem.

cnvqbk9,"Was taught every year from about grade 2 until I stopped having to do SOSE in year 10 (mid 2000s). Honestly felt like they spent far too much time repeating the same fucking things, every year for the indigenous history. How many times do we need to hear about the rainbow serpent, the various weapons, how the British fed them poisoned bread and then do some shitty dot paintings.

I feel like they need to focus on more on the actual culture and intergrate local indigenous groups / elders in the process, rather than than basically teach the stereotypes. I can honestly say I learned more about indigenous culture in 2 weeks up in the NT than I did in over 10 years of schooling. 

Either way I don't feel like it needs to take up a full term, every year in high school SOSE (which is what it was when I did it), defnitely needs to be taught, but the manner it was done 10 years ago was pretty shit. Was a pretty closed discussion as well, remember some students bringing up the welfare and disparity in health between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, it was impossible to have a discussion. Not just because you had a bunch of racist students saying ""they're nothing but a bunch of petrol sniffers"", but because the teachers refused to let substance abuse even be discussed without handing out detentions.",Yeah it would be great to have cultural studies classes dedicated to aboriginals because once you get past the stereotypical shit you discover that it really is an amazing culture that everyone should know about.,,,

chs1sye,"I live in Texas. I have a College Access Loan (private loan) totaling $68,305.15 (including accrued interest) at an interest rate of 5.25%.

I also have a few Stafford loans detailed below (please forgive the poor formatting):  

Subsidized	$10,313.00	3.4%  
Subsidized	$5,500.00	3.86%  
Subsidized	$765.00	4.5%

I doodle pictures of weird melty things and two headed girls. I like watching documentaries and crime shows and horror movies. And more you'll learn!

Let's share stories. Let's grow close. Let's lean on each other. Ideally, we would end up skyping regularly and making each other laugh with silly faces or some shit, I don't know.

I don't care about location. Maybe we'll end up best friends. Maybe we'll end up falling in love. Why not take a chance?

-next day she tells me how a week ago (before I caught her lying) after work they were sitting and talking, and he tried to kiss her (nothing happened) and he apparently squeezed her Boobs and butt, on top of grabbing her hand and placing it on his crotch (as in she felt his boner)
- I tell her that nothing is good about this guy, and I don't like how she is always erasing her call/text history and it makes me feel like she is up to something. Add in that I notice her tilting her phone and getting defensive that I ask if she is texting him. (She was, hours after I told her that he is only going to hurt our relationship).

-now he has mentioned to my gf about how he is going to move out (he lives with his girlfriend and they share her car, and he ""loves her"") and then he will be able to make my gf his, and asks if she is going to leave me.

They work together, so it's not like I can keep them from talking/seeing each other. I don't like them texting what so ever at this point because I know he is basically trying to steal my girlfriend. My girlfriend likes having a ""friend"" but I don't think he will ever be ""just friends"".

What can I do reddit? What should I do? Our relationship has had its ups and downs, and I trust my girlfriend but I don't think she is very assertive. I think she would have stopped talking to him but they work together and their ""friends"" and she doesn't like confrontation so I don't think she would get him fired either.

---   
**tl;dr** - girlfriends coworker wants more than ""just friends"". Grabbing her hand and placing on his crotch, grabbing her ass and boobs, and asking her when she was going to leave me. My girlfriend lied to me about talking to him on phone and she continues to delete calls/texts.",You are too dumb. She's CHEATING. Man up and do something dude.,,,

c8cawui,"Hi! I'm making a short film based on an urban legend, and I would love to have someone do a voiceover that can explain the urban legend at the beginning of the film. 

It would be great if it could sound like a radio or news report on the event. It would go like this:

""[Said normally]: November 10th, 1986.

[Reporter]: Michael Casner, aged 16 and Victoria Casner, aged 11 are reported missing since last night, by the Blackview Police Department. Their parents reported last seeing them at 9:30 PM, after putting them to sleep. When they awoke, Michael and Victoria were gone. We will update you on this tragic story as we get new information.

[Said Normally]: November 10th, 1991.

[Reporter]: The parents of Michael and Victoria Casner have been found murdered in their home on Madison Avenue. Today marks the 5th year of the disappearance of Michael and Victoria. This tragic family story seems to now be able to rest. More details as we get updated. Stay tuned.""

Basically, these two kids disappeared, and their parents were found murdered 5 years later to the day of their disappearance. 

I wouldn't mind if anyone ad-libs it or improvises, I really wouldn't.

I'd be forever in your debt, to whoever would like to help me. Thank you!","https://soundcloud.com/rkillefer/michael-and-victoria-casner

Hope this isnt too late and the audio quality is decent. Sorry it's so long, I tend to ramble in between takes, and there are quite a few in there. ",,,
d5nkfhb,"Swiping everyone on tinder can actually backfire though, since the algorithm knows you're doing it and starts ranking you lower as a result.","Lately, Tinder is set up so that your swipes have no impact if you swipe right on everyone. 

You can tell by the fact that you'll get some instant matches (girl swiped right first) but none of your other right swipes will turn into matches later. Why? Most likely they've already seen your profile and swiped left, or they're old inactive profiles. In any case, you're being shown those profiles to keep you busy while Tinder decides on its own who should see your profile.

",,,
cc9xrwn,"This command would be like this:

/hotbar [size] {start} {slots}
[]=Required {}=Optional

The number of the hotbar size will be specified,then the command is run, and the hotbar is reduced to this size. By default, the hotbar will be in the center of the screen.
EXAMPLE:
       [][][][][][]        

Hotbar with 6 slots centralized on the screen.

And you can use the start option, to specify in which slot the hotbar would start. And also you can also specify which slots of the number specified in the size will appear on the screen.
EXAMPLE:
          [][][]  [][][]
A hotbar with 6 slots,with the start in the 3rd slot and with only the slots 3,4,5,7,8 and 9 appearing.

A change on the /give command would be great, so you can give players items on the specified slot.
","Instead of just a hotbar command, it should be changed into an inventory command, so you can set the size of the entire inventory. This would be useful so that map makers could limit the amount of space you have access to.",,,

d8qhvwu,"I am 23 years old and have had a Mirena for almost four years now. All and all it has been a good experience. I'm planning on getting a new one next year, and I recommend it to everyone. Below are some pros and cons I have experienced. 


Cons: 1) I've gained a bit of weight that doesn't seem to want to leave. 2) Every once in a while my partner can feel it. 3) My chest swells and shrinks seemingly at random. 

Pros: 1) No periods. Literally none. I think I've spotted once. In four years. It's glorious. 2) No babies. No worry about babies. 3) Did I mention no periods? 4) No remembering to take a pill, switch a ring, or keep track of any dates. 5) I don't have to hide any pill containers/ring pouches from my conservative father. This was more important when I was younger, but is still nice when I visit home for vacation.","My parents don't really care if I'm on birth control at this point, as I am 18, as long as it's covered under their insurance (which it is). As for weight, I don't care as long as I fit into my clothes. 

The periods at least lessening in my case would be fine, as I constantly text my boyfriend complaining of being in pain during shark week. The basically 100% prevention kids is perfect as I'm currently studying to be a paralegal and things add up quicklu.

Thanks for your list :)",,,
cinckhu,This is insanely awesome. Have you seen any other things like this for other videogames? ,No this is the only one I know about. I think it would be awesome if they did it for other games.

d04mvlm,"I've heard of teams giving one person a break each sprint cycle. I think they call this ""the john"" or something.

Similarly, we actually implemented a full day into the end of our sprints that allowed us to do whatever we need/want.

d2wippn,"I'm really getting tired of every game having two widowmakers, neither of whom even manage to get gold in elims, damage done, or obj elims. 

If you are just sitting there waiting for the perfect shot and getting 1 kill every minute or longer, guess what, you are achieving nothing. 

I get it, I do, almost never dying and getting ""free kills"" feels good, but this is a team game with objectives. Play to the team and to the objective. Your KDA is meaningless if we can't ever hold a point because you are off on the side of the map killing slower than their respawn rate. 

If you are getting out damaged by Reinhardt, if the enemy team has Winston, if your team already has one sniper, for god's sake, play something else.

See, my prediction is that the really far-flung exurban developments are gonna either be totally abandoned, or switch functions and become more like separate small towns instead of simply a far-flung part of a major city, while most populations move closer into city cores, occupying the pre-sprawl-age development, as well as the earlier, ""not quite as far-flung"" sprawl development that dates from between the 50s through the 80s... the number of people living per house is gonna increase with most of the existing development staying the way it is, but simply taking on more people. Wide parking lots seeing partial redevelopment into things like flea markets, restaurants, parks, even some housing, et cetera. Corner houses being converted into neighborhood businesses. The expansion of inner-city school properties. So on, so forth.

d3zrfl2,"So VW has had plenty of time for this. I believe that they are crafting this awesome buyback plan that will be super smooth. It will be announced on June 21st and goes like this:

A new website has been created specifically for affected TDI vehicles. All you have to do is enter your VIN which will populate year, make and model. The only other required info is you current mileage. This snazzy site will calculate prescandal KBB retail price and average out the mileage deduction if necessary. It will give you this retail KBB prices and add $4000 compensation. Now, a calendar pops up and you get get to schedule a half hour block at your convenience to stop by your local dealer. From here you print your certificate which clearly states your buyback total.

On the day of your appointment you a greeted by a dedicated person at the dealership whose sole job is to take care of these buybacks. He/she verifies your VIN, mileage, ID and proceeds to get your check. 

With your check is printed a voucher towards the purchase of a new/certified VW or Audi vehicle. This voucher is specific to you, it has your name on it with a one month expiration. It is good towards $2000 off a Certified vehicle or $4000 off a new vehicle. This voucher is paid from VW, not the dealer so you can negotiate your best deal and the dealer sends the voucher to VW to get their money. 

You think I'm close to what will happen????",I would be completely thrilled if VW manned up and did this. But I keep thinking about what will happen if they buy back at pre scandal prices and give out a cash compensation and Some people are still underwater on their loans? ,,,

d7ilefp,"From what I know, the Prat Sabre Grip is intended for those who are just beginning in sabre, to help with proper positioning of fingers, since many new people just try to do it all with their wrists.

Nintendo are so scared of piracy it holds them back imo, this is why they haven't moved to standard blu ray discs and still use their own tech - as one example.

advantages to blu-ray:
* consoles are also blu-ray players
*  discs can hold a lot more data (bigger games)
*  cheaper to design games on
* cheaper to produce games on
*  fast to produce

advantages to own tech (cartridges/weird discs:
*  faster (cartridges especially)
*  no fee to the dvd/blu ray peeps
*  hard to pirate

co8aet2,"Short and sweet one for you today:

I was driving home from the store this morning, as I had decided to go out before the weather got worse (I'm near Chicago, it was going to get worse) and as I got to the last major intersection before home I saw a Car on the other side in the turn lane, facing the wrong direction, with their hazards on.

As their was no cops on the scene and I had been through here not 10-15 minutes ago, I pulled into a parking lot on the other side to get out and make sure everyone was safe and see if any assistance was needed, calls made, etc..

Two things happened pretty much simultaneously:

A) I realized as I parked that I had made a horrible mistake, I was very much going to be stuck when I tried to get out.

B) As I actually got out of the car I saw the cop car pull up -.- (Yay they were getting help! Boo I got stuck for nothing lol)

Thankfully this absolutely awesome dude in a truck with a plow came along and dug me out and made sure I got on my way without trouble, wish I could have offered him something for his trouble, but I'm just glad he was there to help!

d9pzyj2,"EDIT/DISCLAIMER: Before any more people comment, just know that I'm aware that her comment was not ill-intentioned. That doesn't negate the fact that it still upset me. I made this post to vent, nothing more, nothing less. No more ""she probably didn't mean it"" comments; I know. The intention of this post was never to cast blame on anyone; it was merely to talk about my experience and vent my feelings.

STORY: This past weekend, I went to a party and one of my friends introduced me a someone who is a pre-transition trans woman who I'll just call Patty for this post. The first thing Patty said to me before we were properly introduced was ""I'm like you; but the opposite."" I was confused for a moment because I didn't know who she was or what she was talking about. She was tall, had a beard, was wearing men's clothes, and just overall was presenting more masculine so I never would have guessed she identified as female. I later found out that she presented herself the way she did was because she wasn't out to too many people. 

My friend introduced us because, obviously, I'm a trans man. Initially, I was annoyed with my friend for telling people I don't even know that I'm trans but I let it slide this time because the person she did tell was trans and looking for advice from someone in a similar situation. Either way, it was still of a breach of my privacy, even if I could forgive the instance for the sake of helping someone else out. 

Patty asked me for advice on how I got going on my transition, starting by asking how I got started and I was happy to tell her about the LGBT clinic I go to and how easy it is to get a prescription for HRT from them but one thing that Patty said to me that put me off was, ""I wanna be like you! You're so adorable!"" in regards to my appearance. I dress and act masculine, am still in the process of growing a beard, and I have long hair because I'm a metalhead but a lot of people mistake me as a woman for it. Obviously, Patty knew I identified as male because that was the entire reason we were introduced but I have a negative reaction when words like ""adorable"" or ""cute"" or ""pretty"" are applied to me because of how often those words are associated with girls; not men. Since Patty is a trans woman who wishes to appear more feminine, it sort of bothered me to know that she was possibly seeing me as the woman she wants to be. While some may think that's a compliment, I have a hard time seeing it that way. I don't want to be seen as a woman at all. That bothers me a lot. It would be like if I had said to her ""I wish I was as handsome as you."" While it's a compliment nonetheless, it's still a misgendering compliment.
","I've been told I'm adorable by other trans people (trans woman and a nonbinary person) so I can relate. The way I was able to quickly move past it was by telling myself that I'm a kind and sweet man and that I know plenty cis men who I think are adorable. So, I kind of identify that way. 
Also, since Patty is so new to everything trans I think it would be great to try to not judge her too harshly for this. I'm sure she will learn and realize these things eventually.",,,

cha4vrl,"So I've had a marketing business since December 2010 that went through some ups and downs over the years. January 1st 2014 I was broke. I mean $8.39 in my bank account. Long story on how I got to that point and I won't go into it right now. Basically I experienced what I called the ""Clientocalypse"" in August 2013 where I lost ALL my paying clients and you could pretty much say my business was shut down at that point.

Anyways, after a few months of trying to figure out how I was going to get back on my feet I realized that I would have had a lot more money saved up when the Clientocalypse happened if I had been charging my clients more than $99/month, which was my standard monthly fee for years. I was determined to build a new client base and charge them all several hundred per month. Problem was, I had been making all my sales via telemarketing which was largely unsuccessful. I had to come up with a new sales method.

In December I came up with a plan that was so crazy it just might work. Not going to get into it here but it involves in-person sales meetings. January 6th, 2014 I put that plan into action and on my FIRST sales meeting the business owner asked me how much I charge. I pulled the number $1,700/first month and $850/month thereafter out of my ass and he wrote me a check right there for the first month! 

Finally, I wasn't broke anymore and I made enough in one sale to equal what 17 people would be paying me based on my previous model and 8.5 times the monthly fee for the same exact service I was offering months earlier for $99/month.

Since I was making sales in person I knew I had to hit new cities after I called all the businesses in my area and since the lease was up on my apartment March 1st I bought a plane ticket to another state for February 26th hoping I could replicate my success in my home city. By the end of February I called every business in my city plus the two surrounding cities and ended up getting ANOTHER sale towards the end of the month for $1,500 up front and $750 per month.

Well in March (in the new city) I made a sale again with my FIRST sales meeting for $1,500 and $750/month. April I got another one for $1,700 and $850/month. May 2nd I got my biggest one yet, $2,700 up front and $1,350/month!

Not only have I been making sales (and doing the marketing work) but I've been exploring this new area. I've eaten at dozens of new restaurants, hiked mountains, exploring downtown, I was even robbed at knifepoint by a homeless man. EVERYONE I talk to always seems super interested in what I do so I figured, why not start making videos? I exhausted all the businesses in this area so I'm going to yet another city next week. I'm seriously thinking of making videos documenting everything from the boring stuff (prospecting, traveling to the sales meetings, doing work) to the fun stuff (exploring new areas, meeting new people) and other stuff like what it's like living in a hotel. What do you guys think? Would you be interested in something like that? Any suggestions of what you would like to see in this type of YouTube channel?

Even though I've been doing well the past four months I've still been hung up on, lied to, robbed, and treated nasty by secretaries.

dhgczoc,"I've seen people mention these unlimited G Suite accounts they are buying on ebay a few times now, and I have a question related to this topic, though I'd be using my own accounts and access and not buying or selling anything from or to anyone.

I have a free Google Apps domain account that I've had set up for years under my personal domain.  I don't use it much, but it's there.  It is the one with the 15GB user limit (I think I can set up 200 users?)

I recently remembered I am an admin on a Nonprofit G Suite that is essentially an abandoned pilot project (was decided to go to Office 365 and the G Suite was never officially closed after that decision).  Since nobody has touched it for years and it was never the production environment, I think it is safe if I want to breath new life into it and set myself up an unlimited account using my own domain (TOS issues aside).

When I try and just add the personal domain to the nonprofit G Suite, I get *This domain name has already been used as an alias or domain.*

Since my personal domain is currently tied to a free Google apps account, would I need to cancel that account in order to release the domain and add it under my Nonprofit domain's G Suite?  Once canceled, would I just add it under ""Add a domain"" in the G Suite, and it's as easy as that?  How long a process would this be from start to finish?  Instant?  24 hours?  A week?

d7x0i9u,"Hey so.. this is my first time posting here, I've had some pretty awesome sexual experiences so I figured I'd try and write some down and see if you like them! 
This one happened about a week ago. To give you some background I'm 23F, long wavy dark red hair, blue eyes, 36D, about 5'5, kinda chubby but cute, the guy in question is 25M, probably about 5'9, dark short hair, beardy, quite slim.
We'd met up and hooked up before this, but we'd been to a bar so I was kinda drunk and don't remember it as well as I should. This was the second time we hooked up.

He text me in the evening asking what I was doing, I was working but I managed to get off early at about 11ish and he came to pick me up straight away. I made sure I was all shaved everywhere, smooth skin, put on my lacy black bra and a pair of black panties, did my makeup all nice and spritzed myself with my favourite perfume. My heart was beating fast and I still felt a little nervous as I climbed into his car, but I smiled and relaxed a little as I saw him smile at me. He kissed me gently on the lips to say hi. I looked down at my bare legs in the passenger seat and smiled inwardly to myself as I was imagining them spread and wrapped around him back at his apartment.
When we got there, he offered me a drink but I declined. His roommate was there and he introduced us, but as I shook his hand and smiled I saw a glint in his eye like he knew exactly what I was there for.. this made me feel pretty hot as I normally don't do things like this and it was exciting. He asked if I wanted to stay in the living room or go to his bedroom, I shrugged and said I didn't mind, so he decided and led me to his bedroom. I carefully put my bag down on the floor and plopped myself down on the bed. He has black bedsheets which I really like for some reason. I smiled at him as he grabbed his laptop and sat down next to me to load Netflix. As we decided what to watch and put it on, I laid my head on his shoulder and we laid back in the dimmed light against his pillows. After a while of watching he snaked his hand down to mine and entwined my fingers in his. I stroked his fingers lightly as we watched, only half-concentrating on what was on the screen as I anticipated what was going to happen, feeling turned on already. It was a pretty intense episode so when it was over we both looked at each other and were remarking on the ending - 'What the fuck!' 'That's so fucked up!' etc.
I laughed as he sat up to get the laptop, and just as I was about to ask if he wanted to watch another one or not, he abruptly shut the laptop, making it pitch black in the room, and leaned over and kissed me hard. I wasn't expecting this but fuck if I was going to refuse. I felt myself getting wet already as we kissed. He pushed me onto my back on the bed and got on top of me, still kissing, pausing every now and then with our lips millimetres from each other for a delicious, charged, heavy-breathing moment of electricity. As we were kissing he slowly slid his hand down between my legs and gently started rubbing my clit through my panties. It felt so good I was wanting more straight away. Wanting to feel how hard he was, I reached my hand down to rub him over his jeans before quickly trying to unbuckle them to stroke him. He helped me by sliding them off and slid his boxers off too. I moaned lightly into his mouth as I grabbed his cock, already hard and slick with pre cum, and began gently stroking it, pumping it up and down with soft strokes as he was stroking my clit at the same time. This went on for about 5 minutes though it felt like forever, staring into each others eyes until I'd had enough and I decided I wanted him in my mouth now. I took my hand off his dick and pushed him down onto the bed. Crawling between his legs, on my knees, I leaned over him and softly kissed his neck, taking my time, my hair brushing across his chest. I kissed his chest and his stomach, down to just above his dick where I slowly licked the skin and kissed gently around it. I could hear him moaning and he muttered, 'Oh yeah..' as I got closer. I paused for a second then slowly licked up the entire length of his dick, from base to tip. He moaned and stiffened. I took his cock in my hand and squeezed it firmly at the base as I swirled my tongue gently around the head. I could taste pre cum and it was so hot. Finally I made sure my lips were good and wet and I took him all in my mouth, my lips firmly wrapped round his cock, bobbing up and down in rhythm. He was pretty big but I loved feeling him in my mouth and I was getting really turned on at this point. With my ass in the air I brushed the hair from my face before sucking him again, this time as I came back up I swirled my tongue all the way round his shaft and tip. After doing this for about 5-10 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and I looked up at him, crawling back towards him. He immediately sat up and kissed me deeply, tasting himself on me (which I think is super hot). Then he tugged at my black dress and just gasped, 'Take this off.' I did as I was told and took of the dress, then undid my bra giving him a full view of my boobs. He immediately started massaging them and took one of my nipples into his mouth, sucking it while squeezing the other boob. This turns me on SO much I was practically dripping now. I closed my eyes and was running my fingers through his hair and moaning as he licked and sucked my nipples. After a minute or two he pushed me onto my back again, between my legs and slid my panties off. I lifted my ass off the bed to help him, I so wanted him to fuck me but he wasnt there yet. He kissed my neck then my boobs again. As he was kissing me I could feel his erection stiff against my pussy and i wanted it so bad, then before I knew it his hands were on my thighs and his head was between my legs, his tongue swirling around my clit. He sucked it as I moaned, louder than before, and squirmed my hips around as he ate me out. I was so turned on I could feel the warm tingly feeling starting to rise up and as he was licking my clit it just overcame me and I could feel my legs shaking, I arched my back and moaned and gasped in ecstasy, just feeling his soft wet tongue all over me and I felt so exposed but I didn't care, it felt fucking amazing. After I stopped shaking he kept going for a bit but I was so sensitive, I grabbed him by his shoulders and pulled him up. He stared me in the eyes and kissed me deeply, I kissed him back but my pussy literally ached I needed him so bad. I reached down and grabbed his cock and guided it to my pussy. Even though he had just made me cum and I'd just gone down on him, he was so big that it was still hard to get it in, and, both of us moaning with pleasure and impatience, he had to work it in slowly. 'You're so tight baby,' he muttered, and I giggled as I felt the head of his cock pushing against my pussy. I felt him opening me up and slowly he was gently thrusting deeper and deeper, until suddenly he pushed his whole length inside me. Holy fuck I can't even describe how good it felt. His cock is fucking perfect inside me, it's so thick it hits every spot, and as soon as he was fully inside me he started rhythmically thrusting in and out. I literally couldn't speak, I had my legs wrapped round him and my head was thrown back, my mouth perpetually open as I moaned, every time he pushed into me I moaned harder because I just couldn't help myself, it felt amazing. I spent a few minutes of this bliss before he said, 'I'm gonna cum already... You're just too good'. I had wanted it to go on for a bit longer but j didn't mind, I fucking love seeing and hearing guys cum. Literally a second after he said it, he pulled out and I could feel his hot cum on my stomach, dripping down my leg and around my pussy. We laid there for a couple of minutes, recovering, til we both laughed and kissed and cleaned up.
I hope we can do it again soon!!",Wow that was hott. Good job on the details that mattered ,,,

dqpewl6,"‘Just, let me know when you are ready.’



What? Ready? Ready for what? My worst nightmare had just come true. My newborn child had no chance of surviving more than a couple hours. I was in so much pain, they were giving me everything they could, I had gone into labor so fast they couldn’t do anything, now they were taking pitty on me, morphine and all her cousins made an appearance that night. 


So I laid there, Husband sobbing at my bed side, my small little baby dying as he lay so peacefully on my chest. What could we do? Hold him, talk to him, just let him know that he was loved as I tried so hard to fight all the pain meds and stay awake. 



‘Just, let me know when you are ready hun.’




What is she talking about? 
It was about 2 hours since he was born, heart beating strong, laying there pink and warm like every newborn should be. Taking turns cuddling, loving and holding our sweet little boy were momentarily interrupted with crying, nurses checking on me, and the NICU nurse checking Ezekiel. Ever nurse that night was an angel, the worst night of our lives, and they shared it with us, those are the nights that really put their emotions to the test. They helped take pictures, tell us how strong he was, how cute and perfect he was. 



‘Just, hun.. Hi hun, let me know when you are ready ok?’



Maybe it was the all the pain meds, but I had no clue what she was talking about. Ready? Ready for what? My sweet loving husband was sitting holding his son, telling him all about his family, rocking him, just snuggles and loves, I lay there watching, trying to soak up every minute.  It was about 3 hours since he was born, most babies that small only make it an hour or 2, but he was strong. I knew at some point, some time very soon, his heart would stop.

 Oh, oh no. I don't want to make that decision.No one should have to make this 
decision for their child. 


The nurse came in again, what were once pink veins were now turning dark red, some purple, he was starting to get cold, no, no god please no not my baby. 
She picked him up and checked, ‘hun? Im.. honey i'm so sorry, its been a little over 4 hours now, he was so strong.’ She was trying so hard not to cry as me and hubs lost it. 



‘Let me know, just let me know.’



The mougre, she’s been asking me to let her know when i'm ready for them to take him to the morgue. A little baby, and he’ll be going to morgue, and I have to tell her when it’s ok for them to take him.


I never really said anything, just a simple head nod. I wasn't ready for the funeral paperwork, the nightmares that still linger,  choosing an urn for my son, picking up his urn christmas weekend, I wasn't ready, no one was, who could be? 


‘Just let me know when you are ready hun.’


Never, I will never be ready.

Explaining the concept of love in humans (as well as other thoughts and conciseness) is one of the most difficult things to describe.

Now keeping that in mind; the brain re-wires itself on a daily basis depending on what happened during that day. As the most social apes, we inhabit a mirror-world in which every important relationship, whether it be girlfiend, bro, or parent, shapes the brain, which in turn shapes our relationships. Through combinations of hormones, our daily life, and primal instincts our brain interprets who we are attracted to and who we aren't.

If you haven't seen it before, here's the first post I made: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4e5ch1/my_house_was_broken_into_today/

Anywho, onto what happened.



This happened yesterday or two days ago, not good with time, but it's somewhere along the lines of that. I'm youngish, and my mom went to work and my dad was god knows where. 

I was in a Skype call with my friends playing MapleStory, and then out of nowhere I just hear shit being knocked over and kicked around outside on my front porch. My dog was going crazy, and my cats hid. I remember last time how I just did nothing about someone knocking on the door, and that lead to them breaking in the time before, so I say ""Hello? Who is it?""  Just to signal to them, 'hey there's someone here, if you break in I'm calling the cops' (Now when I look at it in a way where they knew I was home that genuinely creeps me the fuck out.). 

I go back into my room, of course freaking out and telling my friends, ""I think someones trying to break into the house again! Do you guys remember my address just in case you have to call the cops and I can't?"" They said yes while I told them that I was gonna unplug the headphones so they would blast through the speakers (To let the person know that if they didn't actually know before, there's someone in the house.). All the while that happened, I start hearing thuds and stuff in the back room, like it was behind the door. It starts to stop, and I hear knocks and scratching near my window (I assume it could have just been an animal in my attic for that, but at the time I was terrified and I assumed the worse could happen at that point.).

I then call 911 and the dispatcher asks me my address and all the other things. I tell her in the most calm voice I can handle, so she could understand my jumbling words. I keep saying, ""Hey I'm really sorry if this is just me being paranoid,"" and just small talk to try and calm me down.

I tell one of my friends to get their dad to call my mom, it took a few seconds for me to tell him my moms number because his phone died and he was using my friends phone to call. Everything goes well and my mom starts to drive back home.

A few seconds later, I see lights coming through the front window, and I ask the dispatcher if the police are here, she takes her time and says, ""They should be right outside."" I go out, a couple police officers greet me and ask if my dog is a threat (Basically asking if he would bite them or charge at them.). My dog goes back to lay down and I go outside and tell them that something like this has happened before. They then tell me that they didn't see anyone or anything around my house and to call 911 again if anything happens. They then drive off.

Not even 10 seconds later my aunt and uncle come knocking and telling me if anything happened, because my mom called and told them to come over to make sure I'm okay. Then my mom gets home a few seconds after that, then goes out to talk to my aunt and uncle about what happened. Then my dad gets home and does the same.
The next day I tell my parents, ""Well we know it definitely has to be someone close."" My dad then says that it's someone in the apartments because there's a grass trail where they've walked from there to here, and then says they stole the lawnmower while we were asleep.



Overall, I'm just really scared that they might come back. My mom told me that we're gonna try and get cameras installed and some lights in the back and the sides of the house. And the truck finally pulled over here. If any of you can try and help me in any way, please tell me what I can do in the comments.

Also, I will update if anything further happens.","I'm not sure what state you're in, but with all these people talking about guns and the like, I would encourage you to check your state's laws on what is legal and what is not. Some states allow you to shoot the bastard if they step foot in your house unwelcome, while some will get you in serious trouble. I seriously doubt the courts would find a minor guilty of manslaughter for killing an intruder, but you never know these days.",,,

dne780n,"I just got my first office job. Late 20s, Adderall for a few years now. I've only ever had faster pace retail or food service jobs. They have their own pros and cons for someone with adhd but for me have always been fine but I really hate customer service (customers actually) so had to get out of it. 

My new job is admin/it stuff. I'm great with computers. I am pretty tolerant with long computer work at home, I'm more concerned with the sitting for so long, and getting bored and fidgety . I'm also known to get occasional irritability from my meds. It's pretty mild and can easily be fixed by another dose, cup of coffee, or by eating or hydrating if I have overlooked these important things. But in a fast paced job is easy to hide. At a some what quiet desk job I'm concerned about masking my ups and downs. 

Does anyone with adhd have any tips for a newbie at a desk? ","Get up and walk every half hour or so if you can. Blame it on the news story you saw about the “dangers of sitting” if anyone gives you crap about it. 

I take handwritten notes throughout the day, something about writing satisfies my fidget impulse and it gives my brain a break when I’m slogging through a really boring task. 

Find super interesting tasks to work on. I’m in IT too and it’s a great place to find problems to solve. Can you automate something? Can you make it faster? 

Stay hydrated!

cy7ww1d,"/u/CHALUPA____BATMAN, I want to give you the best advice I can as an 18 year old who honestly isn't sure what I wanna do myself...  

Reach out!

I thought I wanted to work in a science lab... went and worked in a science lab for a bit, found I hated it.  Though management, I contacted one of the managers of the largest local companies around and talked with him... realized it was cool.

Emailed a account executive for an NBA team and talked with him... it was alright.

I drink coffee with one of the higher ups of my state's largest political party (even though I'm a U, still found a close friend.)

Talked to our town's car dealer, found it's pretty good money.

Interviewed a truck driver and found I'd like the lifestyle...

Talked with superintendents and principals about their jobs.

Talked with postal workers and other government workers... found that the US Government has some really cushy jobs.


Reach Out!!! I can't recommend it more. Network with them. It'll help in the future too.  Most will be happy to talk with you (but try to learn a little beforehand, so you'll actually have talking points for them.)

TL;DR:  Reach out and network!",Thanks! This is great advice! I know a couple people in my family are teachers and nurses. I'll see them on Christmas and talk to them. I'll ask around my school too. ,,,

**HALFTIME** Everton 1 (Barkley 11') Manchester City 2 (Aguero 21' Dzeko 43')

**What they're saying at the break...**

**/u/yggdrasiliv:** Howard honestly looks like he wants to lose.

**/u/Sean88888:** Edin Dzeko is the greatest striker of all time

**/u/bainesy6:** Bit disapointed in the crowd. Why would you bother going to the game if you weren't going to cheer for your team?

**/u/phyllop23:** Fuck.

**/u/GhostOfMozart:** Wanting to lose on purpose to help a billionaire club win the league again, I don't get it. (I get the mersey side hatred) but the player's should hardly care, they should be playing for themselves as professionals.

**/u/brianlaukh:** The atmosphere is probably what has, and what will be, killing Everton's game. We had nice attempts and it was sad that Aguero needed to leave. Great goal by Dzeko, his classic header, well done. Hope we can keep up and also hope Everton keep up the intensity to make this a good match.

cb3x711,"Hi, r/atheism. I'm typing this to you guys because, honestly, I can't think of anyone else to say it to.

I'm sixteen years old, so this is probably all just teenage hormones and nothing I say will even matter. Anyways, I have major depression, and I have had it for about four or five years now. I always tell people that I don't know why I'm depressed, but I actually do - becoming an atheist. I hate it.

I live with my mother, who is a conservative fundamentalist. Ever since I first started having doubts about the whole religion thing, I've been terrified to even speak to her for fear of being yelled at or making her cry. So, I silently went about my skeptical business, pretending to still believe all the while, and life was good for a few years. Until February.

I had been reading The God Delusion for a few months and was about halfway through it. What I would do is hide the book under my bed and, when my mom fell asleep, read it for an hour or two before going to sleep. One day, I accidentally kept it on my bed and didn't hide it before sleeping. The next morning, my mom came in the room and saw the book. It was not pretty. She alternated between angrily ranting at me and desperately crying ""why"" to God over and over. Made me feel like the scum of the earth.

Ever since that day, we've had no sort of relationship with each other. Every goddamn time we actually manage to have a conversation, it gets hijacked into either a fueled rant about how liberals are the spawn of Satan himself (totes awkward since I consider myself a liberal) or her screaming at me about how horrible what I'm doing is (I've been told I have a cold, dead heart; that only a stupid person could believe that ""everything evolved from an organic soup that was made when the universe exploded""; and the cream of the crop, that she values her religion more than me). I've been just kind of silently listening to it for a few months, steadily feeling worse and worse, until one day I just couldn't take it.

I had been calling the suicide hotline about once a week or so. I never really wanted to kill myself, but I just needed someone who I felt would actually care to listen to me. This most recent time was about four days ago. I called them and talked for about an hour before they transferred me to a crisis center in my own county. I talked to a counselor there for a few minutes and felt pretty good. When we hung up, though, I suddenly got this overwhelming urge to harm myself.

I'd only done it once before, just to see what it was like, and it didn't really invoke an emotional response from me then, so I thought this urge was really strange. Nonetheless, it quickly got too strong for me to fight, so I went into my room, got my pocket knife out, and cut my arm. It felt amazing. I did it about six times before I heard the doorbell ring. It was a police officer. Apparently, the crisis center had called me back and got a voicemail, and they thought that my case was bad enough to pose a serious risk of suicide.

Long story short, the officer took me to the emergency room with my mom in hot pursuit. There, I talked with a counselor and she told me that the mental health center in town would have a counselor call to schedule an appointment with me. Pretty great stuff, yeah? My sister, who works at the hospital, was also there. She essentially had no kind of response to my current condition. When my mom left the room to answer some questions, my sister looked at me and said ""Have you asked God for forgiveness yet? Because he's the only one that can help you right now."" Made me feel just awesome that she was using my horrible condition as a stepping stone to proselytize to me.

After I got out of the hospital, we found out that bloodwork had shown my TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) was really low, a major symptom of hypothyroidism. So it might be just a physical condition. Awesome, that means that I legitimately cannot help the way I feel, right? Less guilt! Yay!

Wrong. Mom was a bit better these past few days, but yesterday she reverted back to normal. We were in the car and she had once more gotten into a bitter rant, this time about how people were cheating the welfare system and how the government is spending her money on making somebody else fat and lazy. When she asked me my opinion, I said that I didn't really like talking about politics much (somewhat true, but I mainly just didn't want to tell her that I didn't feel the same, because I know that it would spiral into another ""liberals hate Amerca"" speech). She flipped out, saying ""it's not politics, it's just an observation of the way life is"" and yelling at me that I never talk to her about anything.

She then asked me why I don't talk to her often. I know this answer (that I'm afraid hearing my opinions would make her have a heart attack), but I just kind of shrugged and said dunno. She then told me that it was probably because of my ""down, down, down, down, bring me down"" attitude, that she was absolutely sick of dealing with it, and that I just needed to snap out of it. I decided to speak up and tell her that it wasn't that easy.

""YES IT IS, SLJ11! I go through the same thing every day and you know how I get through it? I ask God to help me! But since YOU don't even want to acknowledge the fact that God is real because you'd rather believe that the universe just happened to be created one day by some kind of BIG BANG, you've lost his blessing on your life! The only reason you're not crashing and burning right now is because I'm keeping you in prayer before him. But one day, I'm going to stop asking God to protect you. And then you'll see just what kind of life is out there for someone who doesn't have God. This hell that you think your life is right now is nothing compared to the one that you'll wake up in when you close your eyes in death.""

Then, I decided to try and change the subject to college while we were in the grocery store. She knows that I really want to get into Northwestern or WUSTL after graduation and that I'm really excited about it. I talked for a few seconds about some kind of fact I heard about Northwestern. Then, she hit me with the bombshell of ""You know, this is what I don't get about you, slj11. One minute you want to kill yourself and the next minute you want to get into college. I'm sick and tired of these mood swings."" So apparently now my suicidal feelings are just ""mood swings"". Great.

I love my mom more than anyone else, but I don't know if I can deal with this anymore. I keep telling myself that I just have one more year to go until college, but even that is starting to seem like an unbearably long time. I think my doctor is going to start me on some medication for my thyroid and possibly some antidepressants, and I'm going to start counseling, so hopefully those will help. Sorry for making you guys read through this massive wall of text, but I just needed somewhere to vent.","I feel you man.  I was a cutter in high school too.

ddp57qw,"Attenuation is how much of the sugar in the wort is converted to alcohol and co2 by the yeast. Flocculation is the tendency for the yeast to clump and fall out of solution at the end of fermentation. You'll find that often a yeast with higher flocculation is also a lower attenuator as the yeast will  more readily clump and fall out of solution earlier in the fermentation process. A high attenuating yeast, say 75% to 80% will make a lower final gravity and higher alcohol by volume beer than a 65% to 70% attenuating yeast used in the same original gravity wort. The resulting beers will be drier to sweeter respectively. If you go to www.brewersfriend.com and go to calculators, there is an ABV calculator there that will give you an idea of what the effect on alcohol level is from, for exanple, the same starting gravity (OG) and various final gravities (FG).","In addition, if you want an estimate of what your final gravity will be from a given original gravity using an attenuation from a particular yeast, say it's 63% to 70%:

Example beer OG: 1.060

60 - (60 * .063) = 22 or 1.022

When calculating gravities it's easiest to subtract the 1 before the decimal place and use the significant digits after the decimal in calculations. Just add the 1 back to your result after.

dgtroo4,"There are a lot of different orgasms, and all they really have in common is a sense of release, like you've built up a lot of pressure and tension, and it all suddenly lets go. (That's why you get the sneeze analogy.)

And a little ""wet firecracker"" orgasm isn't much more than that. If you're a woman and you've never had one, your first ones may feel like that. Each one only lasts a few seconds and you end up wondering ""was it or wasn't it?""

But as you get experience you'll realize how your body and mind react to different patterns of stimulation to produce very different effects. For example, a vibrator or a stream of pulsating water will often produce one effect, a simple build-up to a peak and then release of arousal.  Your muscles tense and spasm, your breathing speeds up and then stops.

The build up can take anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour. Usually your first solo orgasm takes the longest and then it gets easier. The orgasm itself can take anywhere from ~8 to 25 seconds. Building up to the peak is enjoyable, but the orgasm itself is usually more of a relief. It's relaxing, great for stress or for helping with menstrual cramps.

On the other hand, a high-intensity fuck with a new, hot guy might feel more like bungee-jumping or pole-vaulting -- you're doing something super-high in adrenaline and you suddenly reach peak sensation and that big feeling of relaxation and relief after it. In this case it's 99% about the risk and the excitement, not the physical pleasure.

And on the third hand, a sensuous hour of kissing, groping, clitoral massage, and oral sex from your true love is going to feel really different from either of those. There's a long slow build, and it feels incredible. Everything you love having stroked, licked, rubbed, and sucked is being stroked, licked, rubbed, and sucked. Every nerve ending that can be pleasured is being pleasured. Intense warmth and pressure builds up in your whole pelvic area. You gradually get to a saturation point of maximum pleasure and it's almost like an electric current through your brain and your genitals as all that warmth and pressure explodes and drains away, leaving you completely limp and replete. It feels wonderful physically, and it can also be really intense emotionally.

If you're struggling to get your first O, here are some links to a couple things that can help:

+ [First Orgasms, and How Women Vary](http://moderntantra.blogspot.com/2014/06/mailbag-4-first-orgasms-and-how-women.html)

+ [How Can a Woman Become (More) Orgasmic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/46kpm0/wife_f45_almost_never_climaxes_we_want_to_change/d06tpar)

The second one has a lot of links to other articles and to several books and a website (OMGyes.com) that you should take a look at.

If you're uncertain about your anatomy or the sexual basics, or you've got a bf and sex isn't working for the two of you, this is also worth a look:

c1mvb0z,"In the early 80s, I attend an elementary school in southern Oklahoma back in the day where corporal punishments was still common place. Now in my 30s I look back at some of the atrocities that took place and their long lasting affects.

Most took place In 2nd grade. I was subjected some really horrible treatment by my teacher. I had my face forcefully planted into a brick wall. Made to spend weeks isolated in a small 3x3x5 pine box. Subjected to public humiliation as the teacher instituted a class vote if I should be permitted to attend a valentines day party. Countless spanking from a paddle board.  And over all berated as I was told how useless and stupid I was daily.

I'm a black male, she was old crabby and white lady.

c5bsqz3,"**Radiohead**
I first came across these guys back in year 11 (2002) and I though these guys were horrible. The friend who recommended them to me kept saying how amazing they were, but all I heard was a guy wailing. At this time my favourite band was blink182. After a while you get sick of the same chord progression and you want something different to challenge, and that is probably where Radiohead came in. 
 
**Jeff Buckley**
This guy just doesn't have the one song Hallelujah. He has so much more. I went through a phase where I was obsessed with getting every recording I could of Jeff, because each performance was so unique. He took in the moment of where he was performing and expressed it in the music. I now expect all live performances not to sound exactly the CD and have some individuality to it.
 
**Nujabes**
 I have never been a fan on most RnB and HipHop artists. Even the ""underground"" artists all sound the same to me. I discovered Nujabes while I was watching the anime series Samurai Champaloo. Nujabes music was just so refreshing to listen to, and he put his own unique (and in my opinion better) style to hiphop. 
 
**SigurRos**
I found these guys as a staff recommendation of itunes store. If lyrics are an important part of a song then this is NOT the band for you. 
I guess these expressed my opinion that music is a universal language, and they express themselves with sound so well that they don't need words (or make up their own language). 

**Andrew Bird**
This used to be Sufjan Stevens, but I replaced it with Andrew Bird recently. Sufjan Steven can play quite a few instruments but is not a master of none, as Andrew Bird is a master of the violin. His one man performances are amazing and you really get to see how good this guy is.
","Led Zeppelin- They were my introduction into music. 

Tool- Some of my deepest thinking had been brought about by listening to Lateralus

Red Hot Chili Peppers- John Frusciante is a genius. 

Feist- Brought on a whole new spectrum of music when I first discovered her.

Andrew Bird- Similar to Feist in the way that he introduced me to a completely different musical world.",,,

cq2hn8a,"When I was a little kid, like 5 or 6 years old, my best friend in the entire world was this girl my age I had met in preschool named Cat. We were inseparable, and did everything together, from playing ball hockey in her driveway to drawing to playing make believe to watching our favourite show, *High Five*, every Thursday. We were often mistaken for fraternal twins, and I have tons of pictures of us because everyone though we were the cutest pair. At one point in school we must have been told about marriage, because I suddenly started telling everyone I was going to marry her. Even at that age I knew I loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, and from my limited knowledge of relationships, I understood that as marriage.

Fast forward a year, we were still just as good of friends, but because we were in different classes, I started to make new friends. One was a boy named Aiden. I started to feel the same way about Aiden, as I did with Cat. I loved being around him, and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him too. I had understood enough at that time to know that same sex marriage wasn't ""normal"" (I went to a Catholic school), but I didn't understand why because I also knew that I felt the same way about Aiden as I did for Cat.

One day I even told Aiden ""How come boys can't marry boys, and girls can't marry girls? Because I want to marry Cat, but I also want to marry you too.""

Most of my modern watches are diver style.  I should probably thin this herd but I love them all and they all get wrist time.  My vintage watches are mostly dress/formal pieces but I've obviously got a mild obsession with the modern diver.  They all have roles to fill - The orient is my beach beater.  The automatic Seamaster was my long-time daily watch and I've owned it for nearly 10 years now. Doesn't get much wrist time but it's been with me a long time and I can't seem to be able to sell it.   The CH Ward is a new aquisition that I wear to the pool or for general outdoor activity.  It's satisfying my urge to own a green watch until the day comes when I own the HULK. And it's certainly a fine piece on it's own merits. The Panerai is in heavy rotation and is a near daily wear for me. One of my all time most treasured watches.  The quartz Bond is my only quartz watch and it's in mint condition.  I wear it to the office or out at night sometimes.  The black bay is another recent purchase and it gets regular wrist time on the weekends mostly and occasional desk diving duties.  The Submariner is probably my most prized watch beside the Panerai.  It is used for office, dining out, travel and general wear.  The explorer is my outdoorsy hiking/camping/snowboarding watch and also gets travel wear with the GMT function.  Thanks for checking out my divers!

cosuh81,"From an article at [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/09/centireading-force-reading-book-100-times-great-idea?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it)


&gt; I have read two books more than a 100 times, for different motives and with different consequences. Hamlet I read a 100 times for my dissertation, The Inimitable Jeeves by PG Wodehouse a 100 times for comfort. The experience is distinct from all other kinds of reading. I’m calling it centireading.

Both of those are favourites of mine and ive re-read them a few times. I'd recommend them to anyone. If I was choosing a book to 'centriread' these would both be contenders. 

What book/story would you attempt this with? Also at the top of my list would be Araby/The Dead by Joyce or Boule de Suif by Maupassant. I would like to say Blood Meridian but it would probably make you insane. It would be rewarding for Moby Dick but it's so long that it's probably unrealistic. If not Hamlet then my next favourite Much Ado About Nothing. 

I found the article through [Conversational Reading](http://conversationalreading.com/what-book-would-you-read-100-times/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ConversationalReading+%28Conversational+Reading%29) which also has some good suggestions in the comments.

dqq8sz8,There’s a level between cycling and ragging. If you do it for 1 minute and don’t come close to a shot attempt even then I’d say ragging. At some point even in cycling you’ll have an opportunity to at least put a shot on net even if it’s not a guaranteed goal. Rebounds happen. Shooting shows intent. Continual passing and passing up opportunities is kind of ragging. ,"No it isn’t. If you you can’t take the puck off your opponent in the o-zone that is purely on you. If they are passing up goals to cycle that is bad strategy for them and keeps the game closer than it needs to be, but if you can’t strip them for over a minute while they cycle then you have nobody to blame but yourself.

I commented on the photo ""thank you for my daily dose of pseudoscience"". A lame joke, I know, but at the time I thought it would be a very funny goof and a spoof. The comment was removed by them almost instantly. A couple of days pass and I get a voice mail from the club manager Tyler asking me to call him back (this was yesterday). I call the club, get the front desk, and they transfer me to Tyler. I can't remember every thing that was said exactly, but this is more or less how it went: I tell him who I am and the first thing he says is ""Why don't you go ahead and help me understand your comment on our facebook page."" His tone was very authoritative, like I was in big trouble. I said ""I don't have to explain anything I do on the internet to you."" He said ""I'm calling to give you a chance to make this right, before we go ahead and revoke your membership."" I couldn't believe this was happening, I'm about to get banned for a Facebook comment? I said ""I don't know what you want me to say. I'm not gonna explain to you a comment I made so that you'll let me keep my membership."" He said something like ""I'm gonna give you one more chance before I go ahead and get corporate involved."" I was pretty upset at this point at the absurdity of all this and sorta lost my temper. I said something like ""I don't see this as you looking for an explanation, I see this as you calling me up and bullying me about a Facebook comment I made and I'm not going to continue this conversation with you."" I hung up as he was saying something like ""Ok I'm going to go ahead and give corporate a call..."" The whole thing happened so fast and I still don't really know what to make of it. It was like a bad dream.

That's about it. It's the next day now and I haven't gotten another call from anyone and my membership is still active (I went in and checked in with my fingerprint last night). Not sure what to expect the next time I go in there in the daytime. I was hoping to see what you guys think about it and how I should have handled it etc. I know there was definitely a better way to go about it, but I was really kind of caught off guard and let my emotions get the best of me. I wish I would have stayed on the phone longer and asked him to tell me what the comment said, why it was offensive, etc. but I had trouble thinking straight. Also, if anyone has ideas on how to handle it if he confronts me the next time I go in, I would love to hear them.

**tl;dr I am maybe getting banned from 24 hour fitness for trolling their facebook, manager called very angry, I got mad and hung up and it looks like I haven't been banned yet.**

**EDIT: I just called customer service and they offered to escalate the call to the district manager (Tyler's boss). The representative said I would get a call from him in 1-3 days.**

**PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT TYLER ON HIS PERSONAL FACEBOOK.** I saw someone posted it here. Not cool.

**EDIT: To those asking for updates, I still haven't gotten the call from the district manager.

Ahri was however one of the first champs I picked up and loved for a while. Then maybe between lvls 10-20 I found her really hard to play. I'm not sure if it was just masteries and what not, but just had a real hard time with her.

I recently took her out for several spins with Thunderlords, and the difference that makes was amazing, it is so easy with her kit to proc of the mastery.

She is also fantastic at dealing some of the other champs I just hate facing. 

I'm not sure if this was a consequence of comparative player skill and character strengths while players are leveling. But I felt it was a night &amp; day experience worth noting.",could be both tbh but its probably a power curve considering your playstyle on poppy is different to an ahri playstyle,,,

**Samurai Jesus**: Let's make an already badass character even more badass.

**Rick**: Notice how they're making him look a lot like Herschel?

**Eugene**: Comes full circle from lying about being smart and useful to actually being a key player who is smart and useful.  Depending on whatever the Rosita issue is he might get killed off soon for conflict.

**Carl**: Like where he's heading.  Going off to be his own person instead of just a foil for Rick.  I just wish they would have used different sunglasses.  Maybe aviators...

**Charles Manson looking Negan**:  A few years in the pokey seems to have cooled him off.  I hope they do an epic redemption arc.

d108xvq,"There would be no Canada, the British colonies if they held together after independence from Britain, probably in Dominion form in this timeline, would have been one united America-Canada or just as likely many smaller nations. Anglo Canada only exists as a separate nation because of the success of the American Revolution and the large scale immigration of United Empire Loyalists and allied Native American tribes into Ontario and parts of Quebec. Interestingly this even greater dominance of Anglo culture might have created greater tension with Quebec, as the French Canadiens would have been a much smaller minority and they might have ended up independent of the Anglo nation if their special rights were threatened.

I also doubt the French would have held onto Louisiana, if they bullied Spain into giving it back to them in the Napoleonic Wars as they did irl, the British would have soon conquered it with their greater naval power. If it stayed in Spanish hands, then the British would have probably pinched the parts they needed in the Mid-West, there's no way Mexico City would have been able to project enough power that far north to defend it. All the British/Americans would need to do is capture New Orleans and send a few small occupation forces up to the Mississippi to St Louis, Kaskaskia and the Great Lake Forts.

As for the Line of Proclamation, it was meant to be a westward shifting line, which helped manage a steady and organised push westwards while trying to maintain some land rights and respect for the Native Americans. Also having the benefit of allowing the crown to grant land to it's favourites, instead of squatters and frontiersmen, as it had down in the older colonies. It was never meant to be a permanent barrier to settlement but the Americans wouldn't wait as they were already pouring over the Applachians. The Patriots propagandised it into a 'permanent ban' which a large amount of the population took to believing, no matter what was said, and this mythologised view of it has become fact in the public conception today despite being nonsense.",The proclamation line and the land speculation aspect is rarely spoken about in American history classes. I didn't read about it until college even then my professor glossed over it. Maybe it is deemed a threat to the cultural and historical narrative we are taught in school? I don't know. I don't find it all that scandalous but I'm a warts and all kind of guy.  ,,,

dj9lum4,"This is a quick summary of my first trip on 300ug of LSD that occurred sometime last year. Those of you with experience know that is way too high of a dose for a beginner,  but what can I say. I was a niave 15 year old who did not want to miss out on the ""full experiance"". My set and setting for this trip was really good, but I still ended up having a bad time. That should go to show ya that even with good set n setting, dosing too high can be devastating either way. The exact timeline of what happened isnt quite concrete, since I blacked out 1 hour in, and only remember brief segments after that.  


Comeup -  One hour into the trip, and I knew that I had fucked up big time. This was something that I was completely unprepared for. I had researched LSD beforehand using erowid, and I was aware of the risks, but I never would of thought that a bad trip could be so powerful in a way that can shake your whole grip on reality, and give you severe depersonalization. My whole field of view was full of visuals where everything around morphed together, and intricate patterns could be found on every surface. My short term memory was becoming quite poor, which worried me. Putting my thoughts together was becoming increasingly difficult. I tried to laugh everything off at first and stay positive, but the trip grew more bizzare and intense with every second. 45 minutes later, and the visuals at this point are very difficult to describe. Everything around me looked like it was pixelated, similar to the pixels that show up on a scratched DVD. At this moment in time, my short term memory is completely shot. I had forgotten that I had even taken a psychedelic drug in the first place. Fear and confusion has replaced the laughter. The never ending time loops engulf me and drag me deep down into the wretched depths of insanity. I scream the word ""No"" repeatedly, begging for mercy before blacking out.

Breakthrough -  Down the rabbit whole I went, as my whole being was splintered into this fractal realm of thought loops and never ending chaos. I felt like I was trapped in my own mind. The universe had collapsed in on itself and it was all my fault. This was the punishment for all the sins I had committed during my lifetime. Never ending limbo...
Everything including myself became a fractal. I slipped from the couch where I previously sat, and fell upon the floor, druel coming from my mouth. Essentially all I could see was the blur of everything repeating upon itself like two mirrors facing each other. Soon the fractals blurred and compressed together to form a camo patterned amoeba. This amoeba is everything that is and was...
This amoeba is the only form of consciousness that I have left, and the fact that im only semi-conscious does'nt matter.  The ability to think is long gone...
My body is long gone...



Goddam loops - The next thing I remember is writhing around on my carpet muttering random words like a complete retard with my pants soaked in piss. Yep, I peed myself...Thats not the worst of it though, because I had trashed the living room and kitchen for no apparent reason. My headset was broken in half, the tea kettle was thrown in the backyard, the couches had been ripped up, and the coffee table had been pushed over on it's side. My parents would be home around 8pm, and I couldnt let them see the house like this. So I did what any ""logicaI"" person would do, and kept rolling around on the carpet, pushing chairs over and repeating random words out loud. Yep I wish I could of snapped out of it, but that was impossible at this point. Snapping out of such intense time loops is like trying to lucid dream. Time loops always get me. Anyone have advice for getting out of the loops, it would be much appreciated A few minutes later, and I catch myself glancing at some roaches- (which are really there, my house is infested with them)-and a thought hit me. I am a filthy roach, all humans are filthy roaches. We are filth that pollute the Earth, that are only here to fuck and reproduce to carry on the species. All our impulses are designed to insure the survival of our species  We make up things like morality, good, and evil, when really evil is something we made up to describe anything that doesnt benefit the species. A disgusting feeling that I can only describe as warm, damp, and dirty accompanied this feeling. Every idea you have on acid will try to become concrete in reality, by using your sense of sight, smell, sound, Etc


Come Down -  The trip was dying down now, and I had enough sense to get myself up from the dirty floor. I went to the Bathroom to get cleaned up. I felt insane as I looked myself over in the mirror questioning if any of this is real. I pitied my brain, today I had really traumatized it, Im sorry brain. I was struck with another wierd thought, as I flushed my toilet. I began to wonder if I made up this cruel reality in my head... Death, desease, sex, pissing/pooping, the pain of existence are all things we accept as part of life,  but under the influence of LSD,  these things felt foreign and sickening. I felt I was respondible for all the pain in the world. A major lesson learned from this trip is that respect for LSD is a must, because it can break you if your not careful.


Conclusion -  Despite everything that happended, I assumed the acid I took was bunk, because I could'nt remember tripping at all when I awoke the next day. Glimpses of what had taken place came back to me over time, which is why Im able to write this now. To this day, I feel like there was some mind blowing epiphany that I had discovered during the trip, when I was in the fractal realm, and I cant remember it no matter how hard I try.  So yeaa.... Acid is no joke, it can prove to be quite the mindfuck. Be sure to dose low your first time to get a feel for it.  Since this trip, I've been very careful to have a good set and setting for my trips, and am happy to say that has payed off with some very enjoyable experiances.

cbhchk1,"A bit of background: in a stable relationship, looking into getting children in about 2 years, living with roommates with children.

I agree that some situations require children to be removed from the scene. That's something both my SO and I completely agree, even if it means leaving a grocery cart full of food in an aisle. Tantrums, those thrown for attention, should not be tolerated as much as possible.

That being said, remember that the parent is also probably very stressed out, lacking sleep, lacking intimate time, and a few other things that are needed to make a sane, rational person. So, personally, I try not to judge if the parent is making an attempt to either 1) ignore the behavior as to not give it power, or 2) seriously attempt to soothe the child. I *will* judge if I see the parent giving a half-assed attempt to calming the child or disciplining them, either by yelling at them or being rude. 

I also agree that there should be some areas that are child-free. Nice restaurants, or even that one sushi restaurant I heard that didn't allow children in. Not that they didn't like children, but they wanted to give a place for adults to come and enjoy their time; because, let's face it, it's not pleasant for anyone when a child throws a tantrum. 

I don't necessarily agree that they shouldn't be in libraries. You can teach a child to be quiet, or enjoy story time... My old library had the first floor dedicated to mostly childrens' books, though, so the patrons on the 2nd floor weren't too bothered by children either. It was a nice compromise. Or having a corner set for them.

There's always a fine line to be had. Children are going to be children, and they will be around as long as the human race exists. They're not adults, and they're behaving as best as they can, or as best as they know. And if you don't have children, it's hard to know what it's like, so I don't think you're terribly biased. You just go with what you know =)","&gt; I don't necessarily agree that they shouldn't be in libraries. You can teach a child to be quiet, or enjoy story time... 

That's true, I'm thinking back to academic libraries, now I think of it public libraries often have a kids section, and if a kid can be quiet I see no reason why they shouldn't be in the adult section either.

Coming back to what I said before, I have played at game once hosted by a club in the Bay of Plenty, and at that game was a 9 year old, which really made me feel really uneasy, especially because the parent/caregiver that was watching them was not always at arms reach. If they had of been seriously injured everyone at the game probably would have been under some kind of investigation. I was at a game more recently near Hamilton and there was an underage there who had been taken to play by his dad, who at all times during the day was right next to him. That was done right, and he was a good sport. Still a feeling of unease though. Anyway, coming round to a conclusion here, I would suggest putting the money into getting a firearms license, which are not hard to get. Or, contact the arena you are talking about and see what their policies are with minors, since they are a business however I have a feeling it would be 16 with a license or 18+. Anyway, don't ask a subreddit, ask the CQB Arena owners.","Thanks for the reply man, looking into getting a firearms license but ill be 18 in under a year so its not to big of a deal :)",,,
cbm3ndk,"A friend of mine from university had almost your exact dilemma - lucrative graduate civil engineering job or ski instructor in Switzerland. He went for skiing, and a few of us flew out to visit him and get some free tuition about five years later. Cut a long story short, because he was canny with money, good at his job and with people, he ended up not much worse off financially than many of our crowd who slaved in an office 48 weeks per year.

So the answer to your question is really down to what **you're like as a person** - if you're the sort of guy that makes a success of things, and makes sensible decisions, then follow your dreams and success will find you. If deep inside you know that the ski job isn't about a job at all, but extending your childhood, and you'll end up a ski bum, then go for the oil job.",Thank you for the very wise advice.

df0w6ey,"Let's assume you've narrowed someone down to either ISFP or INFP and you want to go that extra step to determining their type.

*Socionics* is the Russian/Eastern European branch of Jungian typology that gives us a loooot of insight into how two seemingly similar types can differ greatly.  One of the best ways to do that is through *dichotomies*, or groups of two categories in which each type can be placed.  I won't go into too much detail into how the dichotomies are determined or defined here, other than to tell you how they can help in differentiating these two types.

Please note that this masterpost relies heavily on information from [Sociotype](http://www.sociotype.com/), interspersed with a bunch of my own observations, thoughts, and research.  You do not need to know anything more advanced than basic MBTI to understand the bulk of this post.  However, if you want to do additional research on these topics, it's imperative that you understand both [the cognitive functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/48x9m8/my_analysis_of_functions/) and [how the field of socionics labels types](http://www.socionics.com/articles/howto.htm) differently from MBTI.  I will be using the standard, familiar MBTI labels in this post.

Alright, so let's get started!  How can I tell the difference between an ISFP and an INFP?

**Result vs. Process**

Result types: INTP, ISFP, ESFJ, ENTJ, ESTP, ENFP, INFJ, ISTJ

Process types: INFP, ISTP, ESTJ, ENFJ, ESFP, ENTP, INTJ, ISFJ

*ISFPs (result):*

* Do things in an unpredictable order, seeming (to process types) to do them from the end to the beginning
* Detached from process and tend toward multitasking
* Most focused at the beginning and end of a task
* Find it hard to start a task that they know they don't have the time, energy, or interest to complete right away
* More motivated by targets or goals - spending a certain number of hours a week doing something or meeting a certain deadline
* More inclined to read texts on books or computer randomly, maybe reading random paragraphs or chapters (may or may not digest it thoroughly - the important part is that the sequence is often out of order)
* Prefers being given necessary information and goals and figuring out the steps by themselves
* ""Of course we followed the correct procedure, since we got the right answer/a good result.""

*INFPs (process):*

* Do things sequentially, from the beginning to the end
* Feel like there's a ""right"" way to do any particular task, such as preparing dinner, and get confused or distracted if the steps go out of sequence
* Immersed to a process and tend toward single-tasking, or completing steps in a predictable pattern *(e.g. I am a process type and I ""multi-task"" by studying one section of a textbook, and then cleaning up ten objects, and then reading one Reddit thread, and then playing one level of a Flash game, and then starting over and studying one section of the textbook, and so on)*
* Most focused in the middle of a task
* Find it hard to start over when interrupted
* More motivated by ""to-do"" checklists - checking off each task as it's completed
* More inclined to read text on books or the computer from beginning to the end (may or may not involve skimming - the important part is that it's mostly sequential)
* Prefers following step-by-step instructions
* ""Of course the answer is right/result is good - we followed the correct procedure.""

**Quadras**

ISFPs are gammas (xSFP &amp; xNTJ), INFPs are deltas (xNFP &amp; xSTJ).  This refers to their valued functions - both value Te-Fi, but ISFPs value Se-Ni and INFPs value Si-Ne.  Some implications:

*ISFPs (gammas):*

* take a hard-line approach regarding ethical principles and the punishment, even revenge, on those who break them
* place high value on personal loyalty, once they feel a close relationship has been established
* like to discuss personal relationships in a realistic manner and are skeptical that ""jerks"" can ever become ""nice people"", for instance
* don't see much point in deeply analyzing ideas that they see as having little practical application or connection to reality
* more inclined to speculate and discuss possible developments of present circumstances, or how these came about, than to speculate or analyze alternative scenarios or possibilities

*ISFPs in Groups*

* laughter and very obvious displays of emotion are subdued
* there is a lot of smiling and amusement with ironic and witty remarks
* when serious subjects or not very happy personal experiences are discussed, a serious demeanour
* prefer quite small groups
* prefer discussions focused on exchange of information and ideas on subjects of mutual interest, discussing and planning activities together, or on personal experiences
* personal experiences usually discussed not with the purpose of making people laugh or to boast one's position, but to get an insight into the lessons to be drawn from such experiences
* dislike being ""drawn"" into larger groups where loud exchanges of jokes and quick shifting of one subject to the other are the norm, as in a large dinner table in an informal environment, especially if the group is also somewhat ""artificial"" as in work colleagues or business partners where personal relationships weren't really spontaneously formed
* will tend to focus on the persons sitting immediately near them in order to engage them in more individual conversations or will tend to remain mostly silent, not really participating in the group atmosphere, making the impression of being ""introverts"" in the everyday meaning of the term.
* tends to be somewhat wary for some time of ""newcomers"", being neither exclusive nor inclusive on purpose
* conversations often focus on trends regarding material and yet personal issues, such as career prospects and developments, success or failure of financial investments and enterprises, and the future prospects of romantic relationships, as well as the reasons for the failure of past ones
* in more light-hearted moments, such talks get a ""bawdy"" flavor with some slight teasing
* other subjects tend to focus on internal work politics from the point of view of how it jeopardizes general efficiency, the nonsense of bureaucracy, and how to be better than competitors.

*ISFPs in Romance*

* usually have little time for ""romance"" in the ""wooing"" meaning of the term
* relationships tend to develop rather as the meeting of two individuals interested in a relationship and each other
* elements of ""courtship"" or ""romance"" are seen as rituals with less meaning than the feelings involved
* relationships and friendships usually develop from exchanges of information, ideas, personal experiences of special significance, and mutual help, proceeding to activities together.
* tend to focus on the longer-term prospects of the relationship in terms of definition, i.e. even if it's a temporary relationship, this should be fairly clear, at least in their mind, from the beginning
* generally impatient with flirting for flirting's sake or for fun
* approaches and moves are made with a purpose, which may be altered down the road
* assume that sexual innuendo and approaches are backed by some sort of emotional attachment
* once a relationship is established as being romantic, interactions focus on physical and somewhat tough interplay and innuendo
* playful power-games, focusing on intensity of interactions and feelings

*Less obvious/noticeable but still important distinctions about ISFPs:*

* take a longer-term view regarding efficiency and profitability, giving lower priority to the short term
* aim at the broader benefits of decisions, rather than only at those affecting themselves
* have an inclination for self-sacrifice
* like to talk about where present trends are leading in terms of potentially profitable events and undertakings
* give more value to ideas and concepts that are firmly connected to factual information
* only take groups seriously that perform some common productive activity or discuss serious topics
* reject the idea that it's best to avoid confrontations so as not to spoil the mood of those present
* prefer directness in settling or at least discussing disagreements *(in ISFPs this is often in a very gentle, kind, but honest and direct way - they are unlikely to be passive aggressive)*
* have difficulty relating to emotional atmospheres connected to ""special dates"" such as public holidays *(ISFPs mainly treat holidays as a chance to be ~aesthetic~ or to do something nice for people they love, and don't feel a particularly strong sense of festivity themselves)*

*ISFP Perspectives on Others:*

* Magnetic attraction to ENTJs; also interested in and attracted to ESTJs
* very comfortable with most xNTJs and xSFPs
* see xSFJs and xNTPs as creative, generally well-meaning, and friendly and pleasant people, especially as a group, as a first impression. Later, tend to see them as lacking ambition in the longer term, overly concerned with sensorial pleasure and comfort, and overly demanding of, and sensitive to, external emotional expression without making much effort to focus on deeper feelings involved
* see xNFJs and xSTPs as driven, ambitious people with a sense of purpose and who can get things done, usually with very strong views, as in political issues or ways of approaching work.  ISFPs tend to see this as not backed by sufficient factual confirmation and therefore too ideological. They also may regard such people as two-faced when bent on achieving a goal, and too concerned with their social status, and that of others, within any given social group
* see xSTJs and xNFPs as kindly, well-meaning and creative people, but perhaps too present-focused and lacking ambition with a longer-term perspective, as well as being overly welcoming and forgiving of people whom ISFPs may regard as undeserving

*INFPs (deltas):*

* love to share personal experience mixed with their own sentiments regarding their experiences, but all in an insightful and non-dramatic manner
* like to talk about new beginnings, opportunities for personal growth, and their plans and prospects for the future
* don't fare well in high-pressure situations where they are being forced to do things, are facing threatening opponents, or are submitted to rigorous discipline
* wear out quickly and look for a more peaceful and welcoming environment

*INFPs in Groups*

* focused on working on projects, enjoying physical recreation, or finding out interesting things about each other
* laughter is usually subdued and brief
* smile a lot and try to be witty and welcoming
* groups need to be focused on some specific productive activity or topic of discussion, or else they fall apart
* a lot of splintering and decentralization
* more focused and productive interaction with only those who share their particular interests or sentiments
* jump from small group to small group easily to keep up their interest level
* no demands that the entire group listen to one person or that everyone do the same thing
* believe that if everyone just pursues their own interests and makes some accommodations for others, the group will be better off anyway
* don't focus on building group identity or unity of purpose, but prefer for the group to remain splintered and decentralized

*INFPs in Romance*

* relationships usually begin simply as the encounter of two individuals interested in a relationship and each other in a particular moment
* very little in terms of outward demonstrations of ""romance"" in the ""wooing"" sense of the term or in strong external demonstrations of emotions
* more focused on the present moment
* even relationships of very strong attachment do not lead to constant concerns as to their longer-term practical feasibility
* see as optimal romantic relationships those where partners spend time together on fun activities and sharing ideas of potential practical application
* romantic atmospheres are low-key, based on comfort but practicality

*Less obvious/noticeable but still important distinctions about INFPs:*

* make a point of talking about the rationale behind their actions and emphasizing the productiveness or unproductiveness of different ways of doing things - even in such emotional areas as personal relationships.
* value peaceful, refreshing activities where they are doing something useful and balancing out their inner world at the same time
* have the philosophy that they will have to rely on their own industriousness to achieve their goals rather than on luck, speculation, group effort, or strong leadership.
* rarely display their deep passions and vision, preferring instead to talk in more neutral terms about what they want to do and why
* reject dramatism and emotional affect in favor of wry humor and understatement
* only take groups seriously that perform some common productive or restful activity
* generally dislike using poetic wording when describing their inner state
* talk simply about what they feel or their bodily sensations

*INFP Perspectives on Others:*

* Magnetic attraction to ESTJs; also interested in and attracted to ENTJs
* very comfortable with most xSTJs and xNFPs
* see xSFJs and xNTPs as fun company and interesting people to discuss ideas and prospects with, but naive and inconsistent in their personal and business relationships. They see them as lacking the common sense to turn their fun and creative energy into something productive and often seem overly idealistic
* see xNFJs and xSTPs as people who ""dream big"" and always want to turn things into grandiose endeavors, yet can't manage day-to-day affairs effectively. Also, they see them as unwilling to consider things from the point of view of others, which gives them a streak of meanness and cruelty
* see xNTJs and xSFPs as driven and reliable in personal and business relationships, but not sufficiently understanding of people who want to pursue their own individual path in life. They think these people sometimes become too demanding and can have a streak of vindictiveness or spitefulness which prevents them from being accepting and forgiving

**Decisive vs. Judicious**

This refers to whether a type values Se-Ni (xSxP and xNxJ) or Si-Ne (xSxJ and xNxP).  ISFPs are decisive, INFPs are judicious

*ISFPs (decisive):*

* natural state is readiness
* work best if they are able to start mobilizing in preparation for what they must do
* easily go from 'relaxed' to 'mobilized', but not from 'mobilized' to 'relaxed'
* may need external stimuli (like a movie) to relax
* tend to perform an entire task at once, and to maintain their internal 'readiness' between tasks
* become aware of their own mobilization at its maximum state (e.g., when it is time for action)
* often poorly aware of when the mobilization firsts manifests; e.g., when they first start considering an action.
* focus and place the most importance on taking action
* preparation is considered implicit and given less attention
* more aware of when they are relaxed than when they are mobilized
* ""I will not get stuck in the process of consideration; it always ends in a decision being made.""

*INFPs (judicious):*

* natural state is relaxed
* work best when they can relax beforehand
* are mobilized only for the duration necessary
* have an easy time going from 'mobilized' to 'relaxed', but not from 'relaxed' to 'mobilized'
* may need external stimuli to become mobilized.
* tend to divide up matters into smaller stages during which they are mobilized, relaxing between each stage
* become aware of their own mobilization as soon as it manifests, i.e. as soon as they start considering an action
* often poorly aware of the periods of maximal mobilization, i.e. the time of action.
* focus and place the most importance on the preparatory stage
* the 'action' stages are considered implicit and given less attention.
* consider their working conditions (e.g., comfort, freedom, and convenience) more important than the possible results and rewards (e.g., how much they are paid)
* more aware of when they are mobilized than when they are relaxed
* ""Consideration is very nice, that time during which you still don't have to make a decision. It's even better when it isn't necessary to do anything afterwards.""

**Democratic vs. Aristocratic**

xSFx and xNTx are democratic; xNFx and xSTx are aristocratic.  So ISFPs are democratic and INFPs are aristocratic.

*ISFPs (democratic):*

* perceive and define themselves and others primarily through individual/personal qualities: interesting, pleasant, unpleasant, good-looking, etc, not in connection to any group they may belong to
* form their relationships/attitudes toward other people based on the latter's own individual characteristics, not with base on their relationships to groups of any kind, nor on their relationships to representatives of such groups
* not inclined to perceive their acquaintances as representatives of a certain ""circle of contacts"" that possesses qualities inherent to people of that circle
* rarely use expressions that generalize group features

*INFPs (aristocratic):*

* perceive and define themselves, and others, through groups they belong to; however, such groups are perceived and defined by the Aristocrats themselves, not necessarily accepting those groupings as defined by others or by social conventions
* their initial attitude to another person is influenced by their attitude to the group they see the person as belonging to
* tend to attribute common qualities to members of their circles of contacts, and define such circles by those same qualities
* often use expressions that generalize group features

Note: You will notice that xNFPs are muuuuch more likely to be either SJW or vehemently anti-SJW (more falling in the former camp), for instance.  The same is true for xSTPs, who are also aristocratic, more falling in the latter camp.  xSFPs and xNTPs tend to stay out of those camp vs. camp debates and actively try to combat efforts to categorize people in those terms.  It's a bit more complex for Js since they have Ji (Ti or Fi) lower in the stack and so don't form their ego around these kind of judgments quite as much.

**Sensing vs. Intuitive**

I'm sure you know this dichotomy. :)

*ISFPs (sensing):*

* more realistic and down to earth *(note that this doesn't imply practicality necessarily - ISFPs are often wildly impractical and poor at predicting how well something will turn out or the consequences of their actions.  It's just that their impractical fantasies revolve around things like rollerskating everywhere instead of driving a car, being a pop star, or moving to another country to marry a foreign lover - things that could actually happen in the real world.)*
* notice details more than than the big picture
* more focused on their surroundings, living in the here and now
* more naturally comfortable with physical confrontations *(note that this doesn't mean they seek out confrontation - INFPs are often much more confrontational than ISFPs in certain circumstances, although both types generally prefer to avoid it.  It just means that they handle it better and see it through to the end, whereas an xNFP is more likely to run away or quickly de-escalate.)*
* often more interested in practice than in theory

*INFPs (intuitive):*

* more idealistic and head-in-the-clouds *(specifically, fantasizing about things that are quite unlikely to really happen, like hanging out with aliens, flying on a pegasus, or using a time machine to visit medieval England)*
* notice the big picture more than the details
* more focused on ideas than on surroundings
* less naturally comfortable with physical confrontations
* often more interested in theory than in practice

I feel that people often over-rely on and misapply this dichotomy, which is why I've added so many notes.  In many ways, because of the type of Te that they use and the strength of their Ni, INFPs are often much more *practical* than ISFPs - in the sense that they set more realistic goals and act more 'grounded' - and this seems confuses people.  I think because the word 'realistic' has multiple connotations.  When deciding sensor vs. intuitive, we shouldn't necessarily think in terms of practical/hands-on vs. imaginative/lazy lol.  Rather, for IxxPs in particular, it's useful to think about whether the person daydreams about things that could really happen (no matter how unlikely) or things that could not really happen (or belong to the distant sci-fi future at least).  In particular I'd like to note that ISFPs are often very interested in philosophy, literature, and bizarre/strange images (they really like [weird](http://aetn-uk-history.s3.amazonaws.com/topics-images/blobfish-weird.jpg), [ugly](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dkrAujeDoIw/hqdefault.jpg), [creepy](http://media.galaxant.com/000/150/972/desktop-1427469506.jpg) things imo lol)

**Tactical vs. Strategic**

This is an under-researched dichotomy that we're still studying.  However, ISxP, ESxJ, ENxP, and INxJ are tactical, and INxP, ENxJ, ESxP, and ISxJ are strategic.

*ISFPs (tactical):*

* focus on methods, and manipulate them, with goals unsettled
* goals are defined by, and modified to fit methods
* prefers to expand options
* doesn't like to have too few of them

*INFPs (strategic):*

* focus on goals, and manipulate them, with methods unsettled
* methods are defined by and modified to fit goals
* prefers to defend goals
* doesn't like to be forced to deviate from them

*Some of these descriptions sound a bit like process vs. result, but don't be confused - a process tactical type will determine each next step as they come, a process strategic type will lay out the process in advance, a result tactical type will respond to issues holistically as they arise without necessarily having an end goal, and a result strategic type has an end goal but is flexible in how they respond to it.  Again, we are still working on this dichotomy and there's a lot I'd add if I hadn't already spent like two hours on this lol.*

**Negativist vs. Positivist**

Another under-researched dichotomy.  Negativists are INTx, ISFx, ESTx, and ENFx.  Positivists are INFx, ISTx, ESFx, and ENTx.

*ISFPs (negativist):* 

* solve problems in systems of things and processes
* ""This glass is half-empty""; ""We need $62,000 for that project.""
* usually more reprimanding than complimenting  *(this is usually a mostly or entirely internal process in introverts - ISFPs give compliments a lot)*
* socially and intellectually more mistrusting
* explain how things *shouldn't* be

*INFPs (positivist):*

* optimize already functional systems of things and processes
* ""This glass is half-full""; ""We have already collected $438,000 for that project.""
* usually more complimenting than reprimanding (again, this an internal process in introverts - INFPs often critique things)
* socially and intellectually more trusting
* explain how things *should* be

**Carefree vs. Farsighted**

One more dichotomy that needs more research.  Carefrees are ISxx and ENxx.  Farsighteds are INxx and ESxx.

*ISFPs (carefree):*

* solve problems by primarily using that information which is 'at hand'
* solutions are likely to be particular to that situation
* The search for the solution is implied in the answer. *(I have no idea what this means, but maybe it will be useful for you.)*
* ""You cannot prepare for everything.""

*INFPs (farsighted):*

* solve problems by primarily using that information which they possess through knowledge and experience
* their solutions are likely to be of a general nature
* The search for the solution is explicit in the answer.
* ""It is best to prepare in advance.""

**Asking vs. Declaring**

Finally, my favorite!!!  I've been doing a lot of work in this area over the past few months and I find it an incredibly interesting dichotomy.  It also needs more formalized research, but don't worry, I've got you covered, boo. ;)  Asking is xNTP, xSTJ, xNFJ, xSFP.  Declaring is xSTP, xNTJ, xSFJ, xNFP.

*ISFPs (asking):*

* tendency to dialogue
* much of what they say seems more question-like, even statements
* always, as the other person talks, affirm the receipt of information with yeah, mhm, etc.
* can talk to an audience as a whole very well
* start talking at times expecting someone to get interested and start paying attention
* has a tendency to interrupt and feels comfortable pausing half-way on the speech and with ""questions allowed all the time"" way, returning to what was said later if necessary
* quite often asks a non-rhetorical question and answers it themself
* often just asks questions to fill in time, without serious need to actually find the information asked

*my research*

* requested criticism or praise is mostly ignored or discarded; most effective criticism or praise is that which is offered unsolicited
* performs tasks in steady streams and passively accepts &amp; collects external judgments in ""piles"", which they refer to later in judging their value or success (self-evaluation and self-esteem are more stable/difficult to change and are an accumulation of collected data)
* askers judge their value and worth mainly in terms of verbal feedback - specifically for ISFPs, the most fulfilling feedback generally comes in the form of praise and being told they're ""good""
* ISFPs often focus on easier-to-achieve or lower stakes feedback, such as being vindicated and told they were ""right"", but are less comforted or motivated by such feedback
* ISFPs are most discouraged and hurt by other people's judgment or disgust.  This is also how they tend to express disapproval toward others.
* I still haven't come up with the perfect way to word this insight theoretically, so please forgive me, I know it sounds really strange.  But essentially you can think of askers as spiders who think about and judge concepts by crawling along their webs to a different node (where each node or meeting of threads is an 'idea' or 'place' or 'viewpoint').  They are mobile in terms of worldview or judgment - easily crawling to other nodes.  They communicate with others who are currently sharing their 'node', and require others to join them at their node - e.g. adapt to their viewpoint or mindset, even temporarily - in order to effectively communicate them.  They may have a node that they prefer (e.g. a ""home base"", an ""essential worldview), but they feel comfortable moving between them.  Additionally, certain askers - xSFPs and xSTJs - are ""building spiders"" - they spend more time adjusting the threads that connect between nodes - while other askers - xNTPs and xNFJs - are ""traveling spiders"" - they spend more time moving than adjusting.  

*INFPs (declaring)*

* tendency to monologue
* much of what they say seems more statement-like, even questions
* listen attentively and silently to others' speeches to return to a long speech
* find it easier to talk to one person at a time
* before starting to talk, first ascertains that attention is grabbed
* very patient in terms of others' speech in terms of letting finish
* prefer to finish their speech before letting others talk
* like closure and feeling that their point was conveyed
* questions are often either rhetorical or only strictly motivated by serious need for certain information

*my research*

* unsolicited criticism or praise is mostly ignored or discarded; most effective criticism or praise is that offered as the response to a request
* send out regular ""pings"", soliciting either verbal or physical judgments of their value or position in society, and judge themselves on the responses to these pings (self-evaluation and self-esteem are more variable/open to change and are a response to most recent ping responses)
* declarers judge their value and worth mainly in terms of other people's actions and attitudes toward them - specifically for INFPs, this generally comes in the form of having earned respect as an authority figure, being trusted to set goals, and having their requests honored.
* INFPs often focus on easier-to-achieve or lower stakes feedback, such as being paid attention to and being noticed, but is less comforted or motivated by such feedback
* INFPs are most discouraged and hurt by other people's suspicion or condescension toward them.  This is also how they often tend to express disapproval toward others.
* ::wipes brow:: okay so the metaphor I have for this group of people is that of a planet, whose position stays stationary, and which rotates itself to observe other information.  They are able to change *focus* but not *perspective* - that said, what they see in the ""sky"" - the information their perspective receives - is what exists in the external world, so if they ""sky/stars"" change, then their perspective can also be said to change.  In order to have meaningful conversations, they ""rotate"" to view the same sky the other person is viewing, rather than moving to a different viewpoint/perspective like spiders do.  xSFJs and xSTPs paint the sky while xNFPs and xNTJs observe, analyze, and record it.  I don't have a more concrete explanation for what that means yet lol.

**Visual Identification**

This is a really long and complex topic that I could spend ages on.  Unfortunately there is a lot of information about this that I have stored in my mind but not written down anywhere to share with you.  That said, here are some resources:

* [Filatova's ISFPs](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/36-ISFj-description-(Filatova\))
* [Celebrity Types's ISFPs](http://www.celebritytypes.com/isfp.php)
* [Filatova's INFPs](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/49-INFj-description-(Filatova\))
* [Celebrity Types's INFPs](http://www.celebritytypes.com/infp.php)
* [My video](https://youtu.be/tSuLsxniqI4) on visual typing concerning eyes.  Note that ISFPs will mainly display Si and Se eyes, with occasional Ni eyes, and almost never Ne eyes.  INFPs will mainly display Ni and Ne eyes, with occasional Si eyes, and almost never Se eyes.

A few more little, unedited pieces of info:

* If they move like they are drunk (see: Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, or [the scarecrow](https://youtu.be/acT_PSAZ7BQ?t=1m18s) in this music video) they are probably INFP
* If they have weird, obviously practiced/pre-planned movements, or if they're objectively great dancers even without much formal training, they're ISFP.  Basically ISFPs often move awkwardly, but they do it deliberately, to the point where you're surprised they're not falling down - they have a lot of bodily control.  [example one](https://youtu.be/FtZaRM3oZtI?t=3m8s), [example two](https://youtu.be/Y_3B85387z4?t=11s)  Even [Lady Gaga](https://youtu.be/qzljynWSdwQ?t=51s), who is not a particularly good dancer for an ISFP, can outdance almost any INFP unless they had extensive training.
* INFPs tend to have a ""uniform"" in terms of their clothing - James Bay, for example, whom I linked above, always wears all black and a round black hat.  My best friend who was INFP wore [lolita fashion](https://www.google.ro/search?q=lolita+dress&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_5enxndvSAhWnBsAKHekeB5MQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=770#tbm=isch&amp;q=lolita+fashion&amp;*) for several years - all day, every day.  Their uniform can often be shockingly bland/noticeably unnoticeable lol.  See [Max](http://game-accessibility.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/community_image_1422645871_JNLNEXD.jpg) from Life Is Strange.
* ISFPs tend to go through phases where they try on different looks and styles.  See David Bowie or Britney Spears.  Even if they do have a fairly consistent style, like Avril Lavigne, they still switch it up dramatically from one look to the next - her [style](https://i2.wp.com/www.bollywoodcolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Avril-Lavigne-With-Brody-Jenner.jpg) is [consistent](http://encdn02.mundotkm.com/2016/12/Avril-Lavigne-2015-Pictures-1.jpg), but her [clothing choices](http://i330.photobucket.com/albums/l416/Emmanuel_Avril/wthshoot141.jpg) aren't.  They also can be extremely fashion forward and constantly chasing the next craze - Rihanna is an example of this.

I could go on and on and on.  There are so many little subtle differences that you notice the more time you spend in this stuff.  I'd be happy to answer any specific questions referring to thoughts or behavior to try to differentiate the two!","Oh hey, it's you from the Eyes typing video! :D Just here to say you're amazing &amp; it was really fascinating to see the distinction between the two types all laid out like this.

I am 17 and working on a film project for this years My RODE Reel. I have a canon 70D, however after installing Magic Lantern I have pretty much ruined it. The sensor is damaged and I get terrible vertical banding in low light situations.

I am from the Oxford area in the UK and was wondering if there was anyone that would be able to lend me a camera. One that is semi-professional or even professional. Something like a Sony FS700 or a Blackmagic 4k Production Camera. Something like a RED would be amazing, but that may be stretching too far.

It would give me such a great opportunity for me and really show how great the film community can be with collaborations and working on projects for passion and not money.

I do not have the exact dates for filming yet, but it will definitely be in the next couple months. I really want to be using my 70D as a last resort now, its just not up to scratch and I have no budget to hire out any cameras, let a,one buy a new one!

Before the queen of the damned

Feeling rather unpleasant

But this is all that I am

If it cost a lifetime I'd spend it

Just to have you on hand

I may already be condemned

But I'm not less of a man

~

Am I less of a warrior

If I'm fighting myself?

What's it mean if my mirrors

Been showing me someone else?

What do I do if all these years

Weren't as bad as I thought?

What if the path that lies ahead

Leads me somewhere you're not?

What if all the time I've spent on you

Puts me in debt?

What am I supposed to do

In the event that you left?

Why is it that I'm the one

With everything to invest?

Give me something,

Give me solace, let me rest

~

And tell me that there's more to this life

Than what I've seen so far

19 years, still trapped inside the

Fucking dark

You're the light at the end

That can help me believe

Wake me up from my nightmare,

Beautiful queen

~

I come to you like a skeleton

Climbing out of a closet

Searching for something

Thought I had it, but I lost it

I drew myself a line to hide behind

But I knew that I'd cross it

Words keep pouring from my mouth

Like water out of a faucet

~

I'm sick and tired of vomit

And a severe lack of sleep

Cause every time I close my eyes

I see you haunting me

And every time I try to sleep

You torment me in my dreams

You say you hate me for

Everything that I couldn't be

Demons of the past 

Decide to show their face to me again

Thought they'd stay where they belong

I guess it just depends

I never shook the pain that

They inspired in my head

The kind of pain that makes a man

More than bitter in the end

~

So tell me that there's more to this life

Than what I've seen so far

1 more year, I'll put a bullet

In my fucking heart

You're the light at the end

That can only deceive

Put me to sleep with your poison,

c1wqxr9,"In 2003 I was convicted of California penal code 261.3:
&gt;(3) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating
or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this
condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the
accused.

I was attending a local community college after high school, because my grades weren't good enough to get into any schools nearby, and my family is pretty broke. I had 2 classes with this girl Melinda who I had a huge crush on. I'm kind of nerdy and overweight, so I never had the balls to ask her out or even ask to hang out. (Plus this is before I realized she had a boyfriend)

A few weeks into summer I got a job at a Walgreens (It's a drug store for those of you not in the USA) where I worked full time. This girl Melinda came in one day and we bullshitted for a while, and somehow her broken PC got tossed into the conversation. As a nerd, this is one of the few openers that work, so I suggested to fix it. She agreed and we made plans to meet the next night at her house. She offered to pay me, I just said to get me a beer or something.

I went over there the night after the next because she was busy, and I fixed her PC in like 5 minutes because all it was was some simple spyware popup crap. We started drinking and smoking pot and just bullshitting. It was really great because I have NO game. She began going on and on and on about how she was always fighting with her boyfriend and what an asshole he was. I thought ""SCORE!"" We ended up drinking and smoking the entire night, and we ended up cuddling on the couch watching the Wizard of Oz. Up until that point, I hadn't even held hands with a girl.

After a while we started making out, and to my embarrassment I accidentally ejaculated in my pants. A LOT. I was so embarrassed, but she gave me a towel and I removed my pants. I couldn't drive because I was so hammered, so I crashed in her bed with her. A lot of kissing and grinding and such and before I knew it we were having sex.

The next day I heard nothing from her. The day after that she wasn't in class. She didn't answer my calls. I didn't quite understand it. I got home from class, and started getting ready for work. There was a LOUD knock at my door. A police officer asked me to come with them, and they needed to ask me some questions.

Not knowing my rights or anything, I told them the truth. We got drunk, we smoked pot, I stayed there and we had sex. I was arrested. It turns out after I told a few people, it got back to her boyfriend. The boyfriend confronted her, she said she didn't remember because she was so drunk. I could barely remember it either, but I know it had happened. I don't think anything can overwrite the memory of losing your virginity.

I was sentenced October 2004 after about a year of fighting my case. I was released November of 2009. When I was released Jessica's law was still active in California, so I couldn't live with my parents. They had bought me a 1996 Subaru Legacy Wagon, which I lived in slightly on the outskirts of the town I lived. I tried to go back to school, but you have to register as a sex offender at colleges you attend. when I registered the student security intern told a couple of girls he knew, and before I knew it the entire school was harassing me. So I left. I have had 3 jobs since my release. I was fired from all three when someone found my face online. I am currently on Social Security Disability for post traumatic stress disorder. According to my therapist I have it due to my prison experiences. (I saw a man die from a gang beating, I was stabbed [superficially] with a pencil because I'm a rapist)

I'm currently living with my parents again. I haven't gotten back to school, but I'm thinking of taking classes online. I don't know much else to talk about, AMA away. I'll try to keep up with this.

TL;DR I became a rapist when I lost my virginity, lost 5 years of my life, and I'm trying to get my life together.


Edit:
=====================
I have gotten alot of requests for verification of my story. I didn't know that worked until recently. I did however send the following to the mods:
&gt;I have a topic on iama talking about my experiences as someone convicted of rape. This is a throwaway account. I don't know how I can get confirmed or if I can even without exposing my identity. As someone who is a sex offender, what little privacy I have I protect fiercely. I wasn't careful in the past, and I had a few jerks on xbox live that tracked down my information and got my account banned. They also found my facebook and had that banned too, but not before saving all of my photos and posting them on 4chan. So is there any way to confirm myself without exposing myself? I have racked my brain trying to find a way to do so, but short of exposing myself (No pun intended) I have no idea how to do so.
Any suggestions would be wecomed!

I received a reply from a gentleman/woman named ""flyryan:""

&gt;There isn't a way to prove yourself without exposing yourself. As a reminder though, verification is totally optional. It is not a requirement.
So, if you don't to verify, you don't have to. However, if you do, I can promise that we take privacy seriously and anything you send would be kept confidential and used for verification only.

I have decided to not identify myself. I appreciate the curiosity, and I understand the desire to see behind the curtain, but the internet is a very mean and harsh place, and I don't trust people very easily.

dk1ilu8,"**TL;DR;** gf is jealous and seems to have resentment toward my daughter and I'm unsure how to handle it in the least damaging way for my daughter. 

I'm very close with my daughter having been a full time dad since she was a baby. She does spend half her time with her mum so I do have plenty of time alone with my gf. I've been with my gf for 1+ year and it's been mostly great and very stabilising for my daughter who adores my gf. 

However there were issues in the past after my gf had stayed with us for a week for the first time and my gf said she wasnt sure she wanted the relationship, the reason being that she was jealous of my daughter and didn't like things about her, common kid things like being bossy or occasionaly being  immature (being a 5 year old), and with these situations I always make sure to appropriately discipline or teach my daughter how she needs to behave. And keep In mind there that my girlfriend works with kids as a nanny so knows full well how children are and how, whilst they need to be taught, they are not fully in control emotionally in this way. 

After that my girlfriend said she very much wanted to stay with me and that she just needed time to get used to the situation, which seemed fair to me and I made sure to keep things slow. However a few months ago she moved in with us temporarily due to issues with her living arrangements. Everything went great, she said  none of those things were issues for her and we seemed like a happy family. In the end i invited her to continue staying with us permanently and again things were really great.

But after a while it began to seem again that she had issues and resentment and jealously towards my daughter. She wouldn't engage with us when the three of us are together. Shed just sit in another room looking on her phone sometimes as long as 3 hours, not talk to anyone and seem cold and distant, like she's just waiting until my daughter is in bed or has gone to her mums house for the weekend, after which my gf would then become normal, happy and engaging with me. 

Sometimes I would bring this up with her, trying not to create a big argument about it and things would be better for a while, but eventually it would go back to the same. Things got a little more heated this time and she brought up all the same kinds of things, jealously and resentment towards her for fairly  normal kid stuff. However she also said some things about my daughter which seem to be untrue, that my daughter is horrible to her when I'm  not around and gave examples of situations that I did actually see where my daughter just spoke to her normally and she interpretated as my daughter being horrible or talking in a horrible way. As though she has resentment towards my daughter and so filters just regular conversations as my daughter having some hostile intent toward her. 

I'm unsure what to do and how to do it. While she clearly does make a  effort to change after we talk about things, they do then slip back to how they were and her underlying feelings towards my daughter seem to have not changed, in which case it would seem logical that the relationship should end or take some steps backward. I do have empathy for her that its not easy for her to be in a relationship with a child involved and I now think that moving intogether quickly was a mistake. 

If I end the relationship I have a lot of anxiety a out how it will effect my daughter having little closure and just suddenly losing someone from her life, she still young and nieve and completely oblivious toward  any negativity from my gf.

 Perhaps getting my girlfriend to move out and trying to maintain the relationship at a slower pace would be a good solution, even of the suggestion of it could potetionally trigger a  breakup

I'd really appreciate any advice anyone is willing to give, negative or positive. ",Just the summary was enough for me to say you need to dump the girlfriend.

And I wear it under the dresses anyway but it's not something I'd do if I wore them more often. I had a wedding in the spring and a funeral last month and that's all the dresses I plan on wearing until next wedding season probably. But I usually wear jeans or leggings or running shorts and my bellyband is perfect for me. It doesn't budge, it's machine washable so yeah, it gets a little sweaty bc it's 95F and 75% humidity in GA but I just throw it in with my laundry and it's fine. It has a spare mag pouch and it can fit damn near any gun you can find. It has a retention strap that you don't have to use, but I like it because I wear my gun under my leggings and t shirt when I go to the gym and I'm running around. I know it would be secure enough without it, but the extra security makes me feel a little better. The last thing I want is to be running on the treadmill and have my gun jump out of the holster in front of a bunch of women that just want to run in peace. Outside of the gym though I really don't need the strap. ",I really appreciate this. Sounds really secure. I guess I need to work on wardrobe more than holster.,,,
cwtxeci,"Aaaaagh. I see why no one has responded to this yet. This is a hard question. I can only imagine how hard this decision is for you haha. 

In the end I'm going to say: follow your morals, do what you think is right. 

I'd like to say ask your mother if she's cool with you taking the car, but then you would have to tell her about the relationshio, which will break her heart further. 

On that note, is it better for her to go through a bit more pain now, or to relive the pain later? Also who are we as a 3rd party to make this choice?

I feel like accepting the car is going to eat away at you.  I feel like regardless of what your mum thinjs, you will see it as a betrayal to your mother unless you speak to her about it first. 

I know this really does not answer your questions.  And I'm sorry. The best I can do here is offer a bit of insight. 

Follow your morals. Do what you feel is right.","I would tell my Mum, but she's said not to tell her if there's anyone else in his life, or else she'd break. I definitely can't do that. Thanks for answering :) 

I think I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't, because I'm going to feel guilty either way, but maybe you're right. If I accept the car, I'm always going to see it as the undeserved traitorous gift. But damn I want that car, both in a consumerist sense and in a practical sense.",,,

c1da8zw,"I don't know what else to write really so I may be rambling. Recently she became friends with a guy in her culinary class. I was okay with this. She started texting him literally non stop. I was moderately okay with this though I knew it wasn't normal for her. She started ignoring me when she was hanging out with him so I started getting nervous, she usually shoots me a text now and then when with friends. Then she was going home a few days ago and never let me know if she got home safe or anything. I called her a while after she would've gotten home and she said she was on the phone with said guy this whole time and proceeded to stay on the phone with him until 1am. She called me before bed and told me she liked him (the kind of like that means she'd like to date him). There were a lot of tears and she broke up with me because she felt she had wronged me very badly. She called me after i left the break up scene and wanted me back and were together again but neither of us is sure how to deal with this. 

She says she doesn't know why she likes him and she knows she shouldn't. We are both afraid this will be a problem in the future if we can get past it this time. The only thing she's told me that is keeping him from being a friend is that she wants to kiss him and whatever else comes with that.

double edit - I do not hate hulu. I think they are moving in the right direction, and I think changing the ideology of a lumbering dinosaur like network television must be like trying to steer an ocean liner. The real crux of the issue is how paying the monthly fee does not eliminate the ads. I feel like the presence of ads in apps is one of the only motivators to pay full price.

dbyubhg,"You can't say for sure it won't help. It depends on the individuals in the relationship. It definitely is a legitimate approach for some people, whether you personally agree with it or not. It's an established fact that sexual attraction fades in most long term relationships. Other cultures deal with this by treating marriage as more of a companionship, even a business relationship, rather than focusing on it being a love match with expectations of that person filling all your holes (so to speak) til the end of time, like Americans do. It's pretty normal in a lot of the world to have a happy, functional relationship with your spouse, but not be monogamous with them.

ddnnxtt,"So I fell in love with this girl in 5th grade whom we'll call ""Zoey"",  I quickly became best friends with Zoey and over the years I have made moves on her to no avail and during the later years toned it down a bit out of fear of alienating her but never truly ""stopped"" About a year and a half ago we graduated and we don't see eachother every day anymore (I go to university and she lives in another town about 20 minutes away by bus or car) A year ago she said she was in the early stages of seeing someone from work ""Scott"". I finally told her outright how I felt and she was surprised and asked for some time to think about it, in the end she chose the other Scott, understandable of course since she'd seen this guy a lot more for a while.


Thing is, we talk about this every now and then and it turns out Zoey was into me during our time at school but thought I wasn't interested. She says that if she wasn't already together with Scott, she would've chosen me and was a little melancholic that I didn't ask her earlier. It seems that we had simply missed eachothers signs and had stuck to our friendship out of fear of making it weird. According to her, Scott was surprised she chose him over me (Even he seems to consider us a stronger couple)


Everyone around us says we have the best friendship they've seen, we're two peas in a pod and Zoey's said that I influenced her to become a better person when I became her friend. We simply click in a way that makes my situation extra frustrating. Zoey doesn't talk much about Scott and she's all for spending a week in the country with me or sleeping over etc. Is it silly that I'm still hoping for the best after all this time? Zoey and I just seem to fit together in a way that makes this situation puzzling. I'd like to talk to her about it more but I fear I'd come across as needy.

dj3sg35,"2 weeks ago I was unlucky enough to have my brand new city runaround Scott Speedster 60 stolen from a secure bike compound in central London. Well darn this to heck, I thought to myself, bit of luck I have away from home bicycle cover on my Legal and General(L&amp;G) home contents insurance policy!
So I report it to the police, go through the necessary motions of checking scumtree and fleabay, no luck. I ring up L&amp;G, now a little more explanation, I have a CR1 20 on this policy too, but as it's quite expensive I had to specify it on the policy and pay extra to cover it, which I'm perfectly happy to do. While explaining what happened to the man at L&amp;G he told me to hold for a second. After a few minutes he came back and told me my bike wasn't covered. To which I reply ""Well it is, here on my policy it says 'Insurance covers ANY bike from £300 to £1000'"" assuming this is a mistake. To which he continues to assure me it is not covered and I will never receive any money for it. I hang up and go have a better look at my policy, yup I'm definitely covered, must have been a new guy.
I ring the next day, same conversation, same outcome. Now I'm frustrated.
Next day ring customer services, they agree with me (finally) ""From what it says here on you policy your bike is covered"", HUZAH! So I get that noted on my account and later I ring again to get my money, NOPE! not insured. [insert rude word of your own choosing]!!!!
Next day, ring customer services again, VERY VERY angry by now. I get another customer services rep to agree that my bike is covered. I then speak to a higher level claims person who basically told me that the two customer service people have been given a bollocking for agreeing with me that the way my policy is written clearly states that my bike is covered and that they won't be doing it again.
I've asked several times why my bike isn't covered and have yet to get a proper answer. One person said it was because I didn't specify it, (even though bikes under £1000 don't need to be specified) another person told me that the cover for my Scott CR1 20 'took up' all of my bike cover and no other bikes were covered (this is stated nowhere in my policy or small-print). It feels like they're doing everything they can to avoid paying me out (which I would understand if the claim wasn't straight forward for my policy or ruling was convoluted for some reason but it's simply not, they are not giving me the cover I have paid for and have written in clear ink in my policy.

d97pf4e,"Strap in, this is gonna get a little long.

Three months ago I ""accidentally"" broke up with my girlfriend.  I had struggled with depression for twenty-seven years, which means as a thirty year old, all I've ever known was being depressed.  But as I stood on our patio, contemplating what went wrong, I realized that the gaping hole, the chasm of my self-worth was one of the primary, if not *the* primary driver of her finally deciding she had had enough.  I was proud of her.  I felt wholly incapable of standing up to my depression like that, and it hurt more than words can say to have ""had"" her and lost her over the course of four years.

She admits to me now that she felt like two of them were on ""autopilot"", and that she was weary from emotionally sustaining both of us.  That day on the patio, I decided.  I decided that I would leave depression behind, and quickly propelled myself forward like I had just sipped jet fuel.  That day on the patio was as decisive as I had ever seen or felt anyone conquer depression.  In the face of that choice, I got rid of my excuses, my fears and reservations, and my regret-filled personality.  I was different immediately, not gradually, like most people would be.  It's been three months since we broke up, two since I moved out, and not even a full week since she finally told me in no uncertain terms that we're not getting back together right now.  And I was again confronted with a final test: let her go.  Be ""okay"" no matter what happens, no matter what you wanted or expected.  Be here, right now, and love yourself.

And while it hurts that someone so perfect for me could give up, I realized that the crucial piece I wasn't accepting until today was that the only two things missing are deal-breakers.  She has to want to try.  It seems elementary, but to see that statement from a perspective of valuing yourself, it makes me realize that she isn't right for me right now.  For me, love is a choice.  Having chosen to love myself, and having contemplated what constitutes long-term sustainability, it's choice.  It's not passion, unless you frame passion as dedication.  Feelings can spring up from nothing, but it takes a choice to nurture and keep them.  And it requires both parties to match the dedication of the other.  She refused to meet mine.  The other, equally as large issue, is that it took her three months to figure out that it isn't just because she's insanely busy, she was tired.  And rightfully so.  I don't blame her, and I'm not angry.  I am disappointed because of the fundamental element of this relationship that causes it to ""not be right"", and I love her so purely, so passionately, so massively, that I was spurred to learn how to love myself.  That in and of itself is mind blowing and amazing, and I celebrate myself for having progressed so quickly and authentically.  But it was because of her, and it was as much for ""us"" as it was for me.  Now there is no ""us"", and even if it's technically an option, I have no choice but to press onward.  We both have to grow up, and I've pretty much have done exactly that.  Now it's her turn.

I say all that to say that I love her.  I love her in such a way that I have questioned every past interest and relationship, and I don't think I've ever actually been in love before now.  On some levels, she is the first person I've ever actually loved.  She is the sun in my sky, and it makes me weirdly comfortable that loving myself is so secure now that I can let her go as properly as I can.  Letting her go on whatever level was, perhaps, the ""real"" test of my newfound self-love.  Someone I treasured, want/wanted to spend the rest of my life with, want/wanted to share and be tested with, want/wanted to grow and grow old with, and someone I want/wanted to have my grand adventure with.  We both, in our own ways, are now focusing on self-love.  And while part of me hasn't fully imported letting her go, I now feel equipped to do that just as quickly as I've done all the rest.  Part of me wants to tuck her away in my heart, knowing how perfect she was for me in so many ways.  Some people say that, and I can't emphasize enough how true it is.  She was absolutely my soulmate, and I hope that we have another chance in the future.  But now isn't the time for me to hold on.  She isn't the person who is going to keep trying like I would, and she's not making the leaps and strides I am in expanding my self awareness.  As her friend going forward, I want to tell her this, and hopefully put the final dregs of our up-and-down relationship to rest.

I am a thought-driven person, and I've always known I am not the kind of person that simply feels things.  I choose to feel them after they've manifested, and that's the part of me that might never let her go.  But in all other aspects, I have her to thank for where I am now.  I never would have let go in this way, but my desire to love her more completely has figuratively sparked the wildfire that is now my self love.  It's literally mind boggling to look back and not be able to construct a scenario of life elaborate enough that losing her wasn't the only thing that would have prompted me to defeat depression.  I don't believe in fate, and yet fate and providence are showing off a bit right in front of me in a harmonious way with causality.  Nothing in my life could have been different, else I would be someone different.  And who I am right now is overflowing in the most beautiful and awe-inspiring way.

All I need is love.  And now I can give it to myself always.  Thank you.  I will hang on to you in what way I can, but for now, all I can say is: Goodbye, my love.","Oh my god, this is beautiful. Pretty much the same situation for me. She made me discover what love really is and I have to let her go. I got to learn to love myself but when in my deep heart I still love her...",,,

I have the knowledge for structuring an non-profit and have strong accounting skills. My question for you is, what needs do you have that you feel aren't being met by any of the services in your area? Job related? Social related? Therapy related? Thank you in advance for your help.","Thank you all for responding. I agree with focusing on adult services. Increased awareness is important too. 

I think I can see a pathway for building and structuring a non-profit around that area of focus. Having a mission statement where I outline who I want to help, and how I will do it.  I need to push through my own areas of discomfort and network with people to make this achievable. I believe I can do this. Thank you.

czghpm4,"Brolin mentioned that some audiences were confused, thinking it was sexual assault in a few interviews, but he denied the accusations. It wasn't sexual in the slightest.

dkfr6dp,"So a walk in clinic I went to called me to let me know that they accidentally gave another client a chart with my personal information on it. 

I asked if I could know who it was, so I could follow up with them, and send the police their way if there were suddenly a dozen new credit cards open in my name, and the organization refused. I asked them what information was accidentally provided this individual, and they said ""some personal and medical."" 

I asked them to delete all my medical records and history, as I'd no longer be using that walk in clinic and no longer trusted them, and they said they couldn't, as they'd be deleting important information, but they would transfer it to a family doctor and remove it from their system. I don't have a family doctor, and https://www.cpsbc.ca/physician_search shows the nearest doctor who is in Vancouver. (I'm in Victoria). 

I've been going to this clinic for 5 years or so, and had some other issues with them. But this one is enough to ruin my trust and maybe even take a doctor in Vancouver. I could get over there twice a year for check ups easy.

So my questions:

A) Should I get a lawyer?

B) What is the Canadian/B.C/ equivalent of the US Health Care Information Privacy Act I hear so much about, and who would I contact to get them to follow up with the clinic about this/or file a complaint? 

C) Anyone had a similar experience? What'd you do?",I would recommend you contact the Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner.  They are the overseers of all provincial privacy law and this falls under the provincial Personal Information Protection Act.

dkvkf4q,"There's without a doubt that throughout the series, Walt has held some prejudice against Walt Jr.'s condition to a certain extent. There are many scenes where you see Walt's discontent with his son as he's unable to understand what he's saying and as of result, it's impossible for them to have a more personal conversation.

Walt is driven by his mad ego, but that doesn't take away from his love of chemistry. He could never dream of sharing his passion with Walt Jr. or would he had attempted to. Here is where Jesse comes into the picture, originally a junkie loser in Walt's eyes, became an apprentice per say, and he slowly helped Jesse grow and eventually he was able to make the same quality of crystals Walt could. Walt saw Jesse as his son, he was able to truly understand Jesse, have real conversations, and share his passion of chemistry.

Walt Jr's short comings resulted in Walt's endless efforts in protecting and saving Jesse, and it wasn't due to guilt, or compassion, as we know Walt is beyond that at this point. He told Jesse ""his actions has consequences"", well clearly that doesn't apply to him when he goes around getting himself and his family in deep shit just to save Jesse from his mindless antics.","This explains why Walt called Junior Jesse when Junior was tucking him in after his fist fight with Jesse. Walt gave Junior this long lecture about how he didn't want Junior to remember him badly, pretending to think of him when he actually was just using Junior as an outlet for his frustration with Jesse. It's like a preference for a chosen son over a son who's just related by blood. ",,,

dhhwdd7,"So I'm finding that I'm designing anywhere from 8-12 focused hours a day between work and personal projects and it's been draining me. By the time I get off work I'm pretty drained but I exhaust it on personal projects.

So afterwards I feel COMPLETELY drained mentally and my brain is fried where it hurts to think. What are some ways you recharge (other than just not designing, i.e. any special activities?) or better yet what are ways to prevent feeling super drained after these kinds of hours designing?

dqldbdp,"And the opposite as well, though.  If you could pre-determine the outcome of a conflict, you could also use the outcome in negotiations assuming the other party has enough info to verify the outcome in their own simulations.  

For example, if Russia 2100 wants to invade Ukraine 2100 and they determine it would absolutely be successful, they could just present that to any opposition and come to a ""peaceful"" resolution since anyone else running a simulation might come to the same determination.

Of course there's always secrecy and the unknown.  Russia's simulation would be based on what they _think_ their opposition is capable of, not what they might actually be capable of.

edit &gt; I realized as I re-read that that Russia 2015 could do that now, but the element of surprise increases your chance of success, and you'd have the same situation in the fantasy world above :-/
","You could end up with a race to build and store the most robots to alter outcome of the simulation. Then just bully other countries into doing whatever you want because they have the biggest military power.

d0mjfz1,"as stated in my title. been playing smite since loki and arena patch nonstop and loved every moment of it (except purchasable stats those can stay dead) My main ""beef"" is watching the jungle roll slowly sink into leeching off of the mid and any other farm you can find. Although it was completely imbalanced when yellow, green and white buffs were around you actually had the farm to stay in the jungle and gank whenever you wanted. My main wish if for the jungle xp to be boosted and have more camps for just xp allowing the jungler to sustain himself rather then sit on mids face for 20 minutes. I'm aware that other people farm jungle camps but maybe by changing bumbas to give increased xp and gold for jungle camps and making it less for anyone without the item. I know this will also affect support who are in DIRE need of farm with this season maybe we can bring back midas boots? or touch up on watchers to also affect jungle creeps? as much as i enjoyed double duo lane back in the day it's currently leaving a bad taste in my mouth this season and hope for the day the jungle can return to its (somewhat) old glory.","Actually, the jungle farm seems fine, I think it's an issue on your hand.",,,

dlzhvu4,"so... I (28f) recently got my first tattoo and now I can't stop thinking about the experience in a sexual way. At the time it didn't seem that sexual, I did enjoy the pain though. A lot. It kinda felt comforting. And when I think back now I get super turned on. The way he took great care and was so gentle while inflicting pain and how I had to completely trust him just did something for me. 

Have others had similar experiences? Are there ways to incorporate something similar into your sex life without modifying your body permanently? AFAIK BDSM seems more like a power play, rather than a situation where you feel so vulnerable, but safe while receiving delicious pain at the same time from someone making sure you're ok.

I'm so tempted to go back and get another tat just so I can have that experience of him touching me so carefully while causing me pain again. Maybe in an erogenous zone of my body this time. Oh man.. I hope this isn't totally f'ed up... feel quite embarrassed about this and I can't talk to any people in real life about this","Maybe research BDSM a little. I'm sure there's some form of pain play that's applicable here.

d48z7xe,"I'm no expert on this nor do I have much experience in interpreting these things but in theory;
Dreams are supposedly a continuation of your waking thoughts.

The way the girl treated you could indicate how you feel about yourself or something that you want for yourself. She could symbolize something you are lacking in your life that you desire or she could be a representation of something you already have that you are afraid to lose, possibly to someone else.

Also, because she left, that could mean the perhaps you feel insecure about abandonment (by a particular person), that you are unworthy of a person, that you are afraid to lose something you currently hold dear, or maybe there is even something/someone in your life you have to let go no matter how upsetting it may be. Feelings of abandonment and doubt could be from unresolved feelings from a previous experiences in your life such as the loss of a family member or unresolved problems from childhood, or from fleeting thoughts throughout the day about worries that involve someone leaving - not necessarily in your life but perhaps you saw it happen in the world around you which made you think about it and provoke this dream.

I hope this was of some use to you, all the best

I have noticed all of the benefits that everyone gets from Nofap and I can say that this is much more than just not touching yourself. Its about a lifestyle change and becoming a better YOU. I believe anyone can do this with the right attitude and discipline. 

Personal suggestions: Meditation, fitness, some sort of hobby to keep you busy, cold showers (yes I know it's cold outside), fake confidence if you have to...it will come eventually.

dqvpce1,"Like seriously? Doing summer co-ops is extremely valuable and almost necessary if you wanna land a good job after graduation. And because our classes run til May when all the students from other places become free at the end of April, all the co-op jobs go to them.

There are so many 4th year engineering students without a single relevant job experience. And guess what? No one wants to hire an engineer who did nothing but took tests during their 4 years of school. Oh yea maybe you built a cool robot for your capstone project but when there are plenty of grads from UBC or SFU who did all that plus various summer internships throughout their school years, why would they pick us? 

Honestly, when I came to BCIT, they made it sound like a job would be waiting for us if we graduate from here. Maybe for trade programs, yea. But for engineering programs like electrical and mechanical? not even. The job market is already terrible for us in Vancouver. It's sad to see so many smart 4th year students who would have been so successful if they attended different institutions that actually gives you a chance at getting summer co-ops.

c8fb0di,"I've been dealing with health issues for a long time now and one of the major ones is depression.  It comes and goes, and so I can easily and clearly identify all of the symptoms that come along with it.

The biggest component of that depression (for me) is apathy.  When I've got it under control and I think about what I want to eat or what I want to accomplish for the day, I have sensible meals and I exercise and I feel really great about myself.  The last time I was feeling like that, I ended up losing 70 lbs. in five months.

Then I get depressed again and those same decisions sound more like, ""I'll just have these extra tacos because today sucked, and I'll work them off tomorrow.""  Or, ""Why bother working out today if I'm already feeling miserable?  I'll do it when I feel better.""

So Fittit, my question to you is, has anyone actually managed to improve their physical health while they were depressed?  Is it possible at all, or do I have to get my head right to get the rest of me to follow along?  How did you manage to do it?

**TL;DR I can't motivate myself to eat right or exercise when I'm depressed.  Is it possible?**

EDIT:  Lots of responses and I thank you all for every one of them.  Even the ""stop being a pussy"" ones got a laugh from me, so thanks.  Just wanted to clarify that 
1) Yes I've been getting professional help for my depression for 8 years, but sadly depression is not my only health problem and (long story short) meds are not a great solution for me.  
2) Lots of recommendations to try shrooms (for both the depression and the migraines), but I'm not sure hallucinogens are a great idea with my current frame of mind.
3) I just got done playing the drums for almost two full hours and I'm covered in sweat and my hands are blistered.  Motivation successful, for today at least...thanks Fittit!",Ohhhh yes. Working out helped me through my major depression and my Dr. said the fitness would help my meds work better for me. I still workout because it makes me feel so good. Inside and out. ,,,

dejn9sz,"I have to catch an early flight from Hong Kong. I should arrive at the airport at around 7:00 - 7:30 AM, just to make sure I have time enough to get through security.

I will be leaving from my hotel near the Canton Fair.

I asked at the hotel, but they want me to hire a car, which I'd like to avoid.

I checked rome2rio.com (my go-to site for such queries), and is suggesting only buses (90 minutes, about $15) and those buses apparently leave only twice per day.

I read here somewhere that trains might be a better choice. I looked through various sites, but I am not sure exactly if there are any direct trains or if I have to change trains and if yes, where.

ck07a2y,"**Introduction**

Elements is a To4 gamemode where each player on the team represents one of the four elements — air, fire, water, and earth, each with it's own abilities, both passive and active. Each teammates' element is unbeknownst to the other teams.

I will now list the powers.

**Earth**

* Doesn't take suffocation damage

* 25% chance to wield double drops upon mining ores

* Right-clicking with a spade toggles whether you get gravel or flint from gravel

* Receives Speed II when on grass

**Air**

* Doesn't take falling damage

* Super Sonic arrow speed

* Right-clicking with a hoe puts Knockback III on said hoe

* Permanent Jump Boost III

**Water**

* Doesn't take drowning damage

* Perfect Vision and Normal Block-Break whilst submerged in water 

* Right-clicking with a pickaxe toggles if you get invisibility in water

* Dolphins effect in water  - WARNING: You don't have No-Fall on land, so don't jump out too high

**Fire**

* Doesn't take fire damage

* All nether mobs can be one-shotted

* Right-clicking with a hatchet toggles the ability to shoot fireballs with a bow

* Dolphins effect whilst in lava - WARNING: You don't have No-Fall on land, so don't jump out too high

**Outro**

Thanks to almond0 for helping refine the idea, thank you for reading this.

**TL;DR**

Each of the elements have cool effects and stuff, just read it.

**EDIT**

I've gotten complaints about OP Earth and Air, but look at it this way, each team gets one, removing this 'OP' feel, if yours dies, it's their fault, and it's a big responsibility handling Earth or Air, but if you nether, Fire goes first in the portal, and can get out of the trap due to being fire resistant, and if you look at it, if your fire dies, you don't have that advantage, also, fire can make trees, even jungle trees, erupt into flames, and drop all logs and apples and saplings, it's not under powered, also, z-towering may work well for fire, because of the effects in lava, and finally, airs 'Super Sonic Arrow Speed' is not a definite term or measurement, it is just saying arrows go faster.

cv9hcm1,"Last week was a week of classics, with a few new games mixed in.

Last Monday, I introduced an ailing friend to **Pandemic**, which we played while watching, but not really paying attention to, Monday Night Football. He really enjoyed it, even though we lost dramatically. My goal is to get him interested enough to recruit him to the weekly group I want to get together for **Pandemic Legacy**. The seed has been planted...

Thursday after I got off work late, I went to a brewery where we do a monthly game night. I was late, but I still got to get in one play of **Lords of Waterdeep**. It's the only euro/worker placement game that I really enjoy, and this play was no exception. First time I'd played it with more than two, and I realized the player count really changes the game.

On Friday, I hosted a game night/cook-out at my place. We ate delicious burgers and played some cool games.

* **Ca$h n Guns** - This was first up. It was a recent purchase of mine after demoing it and its expansion at GenCon this year. We played with 8 and I think it went really well. Everyone seemed to have a lot of fun and lots of laughs were had.

* **Ultimate Werewolf** - We had about 20 people, most of whom didn't know each other, so we had a few plays of this to get everyone talking to each other and socializing. It was fun. About half of the group had never played before and I think they enjoyed it. I moderated, which I don't mind, but I didn't get to play *per se*.

* **Two Rooms and a Boom** - Another GenCon purchase of mine. Again, I was the moderator, so even though I enjoyed observing and keeping track of time, I really wanted a chance to play. Maybe next time I can get someone else to moderate.

* **One Night Revolution** - Yet *another* GenCon grab. Played this a couple times with a group that was mostly familiar with either **The Resistance** or **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, and we all enjoyed it. We agreed that it was better than ONUW and the shorter playing time made it a good choice over **The Resistance**, though everyone loves that game too.

* **Betrayal at House on the Hill** - Okay so, wow. The *fucking power went out as we started to play this.* So, we played by candlelight. It was really fun. Unfortunately we got kind of a boring haunt (Poltergeist), but we heroes won. I've played this game 5 or 6 times and never been the traitor... Maybe someday!

* **Pandemic/Forbidden Island** - Finally, one friend stuck around and we played both of these once, until 4:00AM. He'd never played either, as he's kind of a board game newb, but he's getting really into the stuff. His first experience with co-op games. We lost **Pandemic** and won **Forbidden Island**.

Questions-

So, I splurged on **A Game of Thrones**. I'm a big fan of the series and I still really want to play this, but so far, it's been a pretty expensive dust collector. Hard to get 5 players committed to a 4 hours game.

The most embarrassing game I own is **Munchkin**. I came into this hobby through RPGs and I didn't really know what was out there. I figured **Munchkin** would be a light and fun thing to play with some friends. Forgive me! I didn't know!","Everyone who complains about balance in Game of Thrones are people who play it often enough to notice balance issues. In my group it almost never comes out, and when it does it's engrossing enough that after around six or seven games (only one with all 6 players) we're all happy with the hama and nobody is complaining about balance yet. We did make a house rule against attacking the neutral territories in the south, though, to encourage people to attack each other.",,,
di00f61,"**Tommy:** Welcome to the Update Show, everyone. I'm Tommy Marquez and I'm joined with Rory McKernan and Sean Woodland.

**Rory:** Well, Week 1 of the r/CrossFit Fantasy Regionals is in the books, and what a week it was. From injuries amongst the men to surprise results amongst the women, this was a dramatic week that is forcing everybody to reexamine their assumptions about what this year's Fantasy Games Podium is going to look like.

**Sean:** That's right, Rory. It's obvious that everyone was looking to u/adsherlock to see if he would repeat his incredible performance from last year. So far, though, the only thing incredible about this fantasy athlete has been the disappointment.

&gt;*cut to video of u/adsherlock picking Albert Dominic-Larouche from a Google Forms dropdown*

**Rory:** Ouch, that's tough to watch. And with u/ttujohn not doing much better and u/docwood2011 sitting this year out for ""family reasons"" -

&gt;*hosts exchange dramatic sarcastic glances*

**Rory:** - the field is left clear for some new blood. 

**Tommy:** That's right, and this week was *covered* with new blood. Let's talk winners: u/tinyhuman_ is on top, u/aaronsbrother is less than 200 points behind him, and u/girdora stands in third. 

**Sean:** Now u/tinyhuman_ - this guy was what, 37th last year? He's been training all year, reading every BarBend article, studying every Update Show, watching every sponsored video. It has to feel great to see all of that work finally paying off, and in a big way. 200 points is *not* a small lead for this early in the competition.

**Rory:** That's true, but what I'm more interested in is u/aaronsbrother. This guy came in 8th place last year, and clearly his dreams did not stop at a top ten finish. 200 points may seem large, but athletes can gain or lose more that in a single event. I'm personally very excited to see his chase for the top prize.

**Tommy:** He's going to have to fend off an extremely aggressive run by the rookie u/girdora, though. Does this person whose gender is unclear have the endurance to maintain this performance at the Fantasy Regional level? We've seen too many rookies go hard and then burn out.

**Rory:** To be fair, I think u/girdora has it. For those who have been watching his/her Fantasy Instagram, you've seen him/her practicing reading BoxLife magazine, tearing through huge spreadsheets of Fantasy data, and carefully scrutinizing Real Instagram posts for hours at a time.

**Tommy:** *mumbles something about being fair to Rory's mother*

**Sean:** Alllllll right that is all the time we have this week! Be sure to [read the full listings here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQ1PfmA2XaYRrR1hjozczXigaxHgrSxqiiQMwdnF-iQ/edit?usp=sharing) and tune in next week!","Oh what is going on?? FIRST?!

crzcoe9,"On Monday I bent over to tie my work boots while getting ready to leave for work. The bending caused my sciatic nerve on the left side to be pinched so severely that I fell down from pain and couldn't get back up. Luckily my purse was right next to me so I could use my phone. I called work and said I'd be late if I was even able to come in. I called my husband and he started heading home to help me get up and go to the doctor. It was going to take him a while because they had sent him to a different location for the day. Hour and half later he gets home and we go to the ER where they give me shots for the pain, pain meds to take home and some stretches to help loosen up the muscles around my sciatic nerve. I was in pain for a few days but the meds and stretches were helping. 

Friday I was feeling pretty normal until I sat down on the floor to play with my rabbit. When I went to get up I pinched the right side sciatic nerve, though not nearly as bad as the first time. I took my pain meds and headed to work and throughout the day I was sour but functional. Yesterday I felt fine again. I didn't take any pain meds but still did my stretches. Then we get to today and I was in the shower getting ready for my nephew's birthday pool party. Since it's a pool party I was shaving my legs and pinched the damn right side nerve again. 

I know this is pretty minor and not life threatening but it's so annoying to deal with. I am on the same pain medication and stretching exercises and my 85 year old grandma. People at work make fun of me for being an old lady and rightfully so.

cpsdbmi,"So finally after two and a half years of trying my husband and I agreed to try clomid, I cried all the way home. I am 26 and my husband 28.

Last May  we both got tested. DH did a SA -normal. I had an HSG - everything normal. No PCOS and I have a period every month: hormones are fine. Still nothing. I tried not worrying and just trying to have fun. Nothing. 
Because of the heart break I started saying ""I can't have kids"" I know it's Aweful to say but I guess I was trying to shield my heart. 
It's stupid every month I'll get cravings and nausea... A lot of the ""symptoms"" and every month another heartbreak. I get so angry when I read stories about people abusing children and all I think is ""she can have a baby and I can't..."" Teenagers but not someone who is more established?? And still the question arises with every new meeting ""why are you guys waiting to have kids""
I'll watch woman with kids and see how they can never understand my pain because it's not a big deal to them they can never understand the almost emptiness I feel. The failure to not be able to do the one thing I am supposed to do. (I know that's not true but my family is very old fashion and having children was beat into me)

DH is a sweet man but he ignores it and just says ""when the times right it'll happen"" which rubs me the wrong way.

This probably isn't painting me in the best light but it's real. So on to my main bit. I picked up my clomid yesterday and started the metoformin last night. On the way home I was crying and asked myself ""if I was pregnant right now... How would I feel?"" ... Happy. ""If it were twins?"" ... Happy. ""Then what am I afraid of?""

I think I'm afraid that it won't work... Then my last hope will be for not... Then I'll be telling the truth when I say I can't have children. There is my fear.

I was hoping to have all my children before I was 30. We got married young and we've lived a very loved life. All of my friends are working on baby 2 or 3 and its frustrating. 

I guess I'm just wanting to get this out of me and maybe hear from anyone who might understand how I feel.

c7n1xts,"I have a roughly 3 and a half year old pit or pit/mastiff mix that I need to rehome. I rescued him two years ago. I already had my great dane when I decided to get him a friend and rescued Blu. They are super best friends but my pit is now having dominance issues. We have tried everything we can think of with training and professionals and discipline, you name it, but it's only gotten worse and finally on Christmas Blu chewed up my dane's face. Blu needs to go to a home with no other dogs, but preferably to someone who has dog experience and can handle a large, stubborn dog. 

I cannot stress enough how sweet and amazing he is, but he needs a firm hand to tell him no. The rescue picked him up off the side of the road with a mangled front leg, which they amputated, so we can only guess that he was a bait dog or a street dog. Either way, up until he was about a year and a half old he had no training or formal human contact, and it shows in his inability to listen all the time. He now knows sit and down and wait (usually), and we require manners from him (like sitting and waiting at a door, waiting for us to go through doorways and downstairs before him, etc). 

He is the sweetest, most loving, wonderful dog in the world. He gets along great with cats and all manner of critters. He loves every person he's ever met and he does like to play with dogs, but he probably shouldn't live with one. He would be happiest sleeping in bed with you and sitting in your lap while you watch TV, though we never allowed him to. This truly wrecks me to have to rehome him, I feel like I'm giving away my child. But it is probably the best thing for all parties involved. 

It would severely lessen my agony if I could keep in touch with his new people and visit every so often.

cokcuzm,"I've been in the same boat for the last 6 years. I didn't have a goal during undergrad and graduated with a 2.75 GPA. Not bad, but not great. I've been working professionally full time, but taking classes when I can. Being in a science-based field, it's much harder to make up for the screw-ups we did during undergrad.

I think you are correct on identifying what your options are. I'd also recommend trying to either get an internship or a job that somehow relates to the field. Do anything to get your foot in the door. But keep looking at every school that has a Masters in Meterology. You might find one that allows a lower GPA. I've just been accepted to one Masters program because I have an excellent work history in my field and I emphasized that I have better study habits and a clear goal in my admissions statement.

One other thing to keep in mind: pay attention to how many credits you have when attending classes. When I graduated, I had close to 170. Because I had such a high credit load, it made it much harder to bring up the cumulative GPA, even if I took 4-5 credit courses. So after taking an additional 25 credits, I'm just barely above 2.85. If that's your situation, it might be better for you to go with option 2 and get a second bachelors.

1. Spider-man

2. Aiden Spider-man

On Tuesday 1/20/2015 at 2:59 P.M., I received the worst call a father could ever receive.  ""Hi, this is your babysitter.  Aiden fell down the stairs and is incoherent.  We're calling the squad.""  I immediately left work.  At 3:06 P.M., I received another call ""The squad has Aiden and they're taking him to Nationwide Children's Hospital"".  I immediately changed my course and started going to Children's Hospital.

As I arrived at the Emergency Room parking lot at Children's Hospital I heard sirens in the background.  As I was walking towards the doors of the ER the ambulance pulled up to the doors.  As I was walking by I looked in and noticed a small child taking up very little of the gurney he was on.  I asked ""Is that Aiden"" to which they replied ""Yes"".  I said ""I am his dad.""  They stopped briefly to let me tell him ""Aiden, daddy is here with you."" before they rushed into the ER.  When I told him this his eyes were open, but he didn't look for me or make any movements as if he noticed I was there.

I followed behind the EMS to the emergency room they were putting Aiden in.  As I entered the room I noticed at least 15 doctors and nurses all scrambling and shouting things like ""This is a level 1 trauma"" and ""We need to intubate"".  I looked at Aiden and noticed that his arms were straight up in the air while his wrists were bent at a 180 degree angle straight to the ground.  This is an image I feel I will never be able to forget.  

A social worker begins to introduce herself. A chaplan is introducing herself at the same time, all while also asking questions.  At the same time a EMT was asking me questions as well.  I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed.  At this point I stepped back, pulled out my phone and called my dad.  ""Dad.  Please come to Children's Hospital.  Aiden has had an accident and it looks bad"".  After this I called Aiden's mom as well as my girlfriend.  Knowing that I had support on the way I felt like I could answer the questions being asked.

I began to answer all of the questions of the social worker, chaplan, and the firefighter.  After I'm finished answering questions the chaplan informs me that the babysitter is in a waiting area and encourages me to find out exactly what had happened from her.  The babysitter repeated the original explanation that Aiden had fallen down the stairs and hit his head.

After leaving the waiting room and going back to the room with the doctors I immediately heard ""We need to get a CT scan.""  They started to push Aiden's bed out the door and told me ""Dad, follow us.""  After the CT is taken I hear ""Okay, lets head to the ICU.""  As we're leaving the imaging room a doctor's phone rings and I hear ""Stop.  We're taking him to surgery"".

As we're rushing to surgery doctors are frantically telling me what is going to be happening to my baby boy.  ""We're going to have to remove a piece of his skull to give additional space for the brain to swell.""  I'm dropped off at the surgery recovery room.

Finally, my dad and Aiden's mom shows up as well as other family.  Two long hours later a doctor pulls Aiden's mom and me into a room to discuss their results and findings.

""First, the operation was a success.  We've removed a piece of his skull which will help give the brain additional room to swell.  Will you give me a recount of exactly what caused this?""

I tell them the story the babysitter told me

""Aiden suffered a good amount of brain damage.  For this amount of brain damage Aiden would have had to hit the ground really hard.  The kind of impact to cause this amount of damage would have left a bad bruise, or a bump, or a skull fracture.  I'm not seeing any of this.  It's my opinion that this wasn't caused by a fall.""

The doctor explained what he thinks caused Aiden's injuries.  I cannot elaborate here because there is an on-going investigation.  Once this investigation is finished I will then edit this to add additional information.

Aiden was then transferred up to the ICU where we've spent our last three days.  Aiden is in very critical condition at the moment.  Please send prayers his way.

If she likes you she will confirm. If she can't make it she will try to reschedule.

cqfffz9,"...Really? I mean, I've been a die hard Breaking Bad fan since the first season (I picked it up with the season finale and went through the entire season after that). It's on par with The Wire for me in terms of all time greatest television show. That said, the entire final season was a let down, both halves of it.

The main villains for the series? A Nazi group that showed up at the end of the first half of the season. They're nowhere near Gus levels of villainy or complexity. Just some rednecks with connections everywhere. It looks like they were set up as a foil to Gus and his operation, but that just didn't make for compelling viewing. It was nice to see Lance after his football career panned out but not when it comes to wrapping the final season of what could have been the greatest television series of all time.

Hank was a wasted character and opportunity. He's been around since the very first episode, he indirectly caused Walt to go down the drug path (remember, Walt sees the money from the drug bust in the first episode, asks Hank how much it is, then Hank *offers* to bring Walt along on a raid). He and Walt have a small sparring back and forth over the legality and the tape, and things seem to be reaching a boiling point with Jesse, until it blows over entirely and Jesse is just a meth slave, while Hank is in a shallow grave. The cunning and epic showdown with Gus is a thing of the past.

I remember Vince Gilligan being interviewed and admitting that they shot the scene with Walt buying the M60 without any idea of what he would use it for or how it would play out. Yeah, it shows. A lot of the final season felt dragged out, like they were just filling episodes to pad the season out into two halves, and it's pretty telling that the first episode of the season was written without any idea how the ending would play out. The show should have ended with the Gus season.

dhrhlxd,"His ""plausible justification"" is that he was just sharing pertinent information and intelligence with another country in order to build a partnership and trust.

That doesn't even sound that bad, except that *that's not how you do that*, and you let intelligence services- or maybe the State Department- handle that, as that's their fucking job and you're a president who can't even be bothered to read your PDB.

But what's funny is Snowden and Manning's ""plausible justification"" is *just as fucking stupid*, but yet we have people on this website eat it up and call them heroes.  Manning didn't even read what she leaked (none of it was even bad).  Then let Wikileaks use it as propaganda.  Snowden leaked a legal operation and tons of overseas shit that had nothing to do with the justification he used publicly and, oh yeah, he went to fucking China with classified shit and the only reason anyone (who doesn't work in intelligence) believes that he didn't give them anything other than what he disclosed publicly is because he said so.

The 'TE' part is really key. Most people here would probably be radical feminists rather than liberal ones, but the TE part is a contamination in the ideology.

dl2sfy0,"OK so my family are all exotic pet enthusiasts. I bought a Giant Asian Mantis (Hierodula membranacea) because I've always wanted a pet mantis since I was very young. I decided I wanted the biggest species I could buy, so that's why I bought that specific kind.

OK so my family all have their own exotic pets inside our pet room. We have stick insects, leopard geckos, crested geckos, bearded dragons, lubber grasshoppers, comet goldfish and even a sugar glider. The room pretty much looks like an aquarium with all the vivs, cages and tanks.

My Mantis was rather new and I didn't have a tank setup ready for him when he arrived. I instead placed him on a perch inside the room and let him roam around freely, thinking he'd stick to his perch and not escape into other tanks. I knew that the animals were contained so nothing could get into their tanks anyway so I thought it would be OK temporarily. 

My brothers goldfish was in a tank right near to where I left the mantis. I never thought the mantis would go anywhere near the fish never mind eat it. The tank had an open top but because it was filled with water I thought it would be OK. My dad text me though and told me he found my mantis standing on the side of the tank eating my little brothers goldfish.

I felt awful because the animal I bought killed my little brothers only pet. He is young (only 8 years old) and will hate me if he thinks his fish died. I panicked and went to petsmart and bought a new fish as a replacement and he hasn't noticed a difference yet.

I feel guilty still though. He sits there by the tank feeding his fish knowing none the wiser, whilst me and the rest of my family know what happened. The fish always made my brother so happy and he always used to talk to his fish and tell it how much he loves it. It might sound over the top but I just feel as though I was responsible for the death of his best friend. I should have owned up to it but instead I replaced the fish because I was too much of a coward to make my little brother cry.","you made a mistake and you feel awful, don't beat yourself up over the actions of a pet you couldn't control.

c0yqdfc,"I don't think that this is solely an algorithm problem, I see it more as a ""travelling salesman"" type of problem usually associated with graphs.

The idea is simple : Take a (possibly recursive) graph and lock random nodes gradually while making sure that the player can find enough keys to open them no matter what path he takes in the labyrinth.

I use a bidirectional graph instead of a n-tree because I would like it to work even if some node have more than one path from the root, otherwise the game will just end up being a big linear labyrinth. 

Right now I take a randomly generated graph, do a Depth First Search to extract a tree using the player starting node as the root, lock a random node and remove the vertices either sides of that node. This is done to ensure that the next Depth First extraction doesn't take that node into account in the graph, like if it was a locked door. That second search gives me all the node that can be reached from the starting node even if this door (and others) are locked and I don't have the key.

So far so good, but the problem is that sometime I can lock a node in front of a necessary key.

For example :

      S---1-----2-----3
          |      |
          4-----5-----6

Numbers are nodes, ascii art is vertices.

If I lock door 2 and place the key at 6, I get a valid path :


      S---1-----2L-----3
          |      |
          4-----5 -----6K


Every doors can be opened, no matter what order they are opened, but there is only one door ;) Now, I lock door 5 and place the key at 4 :


      S---1-----2L-----3
          |      |
          4K----5L-----6K


If the player grab the key at 4 and open the door at 2 he will not have a key to open the door at 5 anymore because the key is now behind a locked door.

Hopefully this makes sense...

My next step is to code a 'bot that would try all combinations of nodes/key and reject invalid graphs, but that would be too slow to use that concept the way I want.

Any geniuses? This project took too much of my time to just abandon it...","I'm not sure that I entirely understand your problem (what is a recursive graph?), but it seems to me like you are making it too difficult for yourself.

Why not just choose a place to lock (or multiple places if you want to make it more interesting) and place a key somewhere the player is able to find, and then instead of determining the entire thing from the start, determine the next doors to lock and keys after the player unlocks a door?

tldr - don't determine everything right away, generate new locks and keys as the player unlocks more doors.",,,

decwo2c,"I have been waiting for this moment my whole life.  Sleep Expert here.

 The reason one does not feel pain while they sleep is because when you sleep, “most neurons in the brain stem immediately above the spinal cord, reduce or stop firing.” The brain stem is composed of the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain. The brain stem is in a way, a highway where the motor and sensory system passes through to the brain. Therefore, while awake, the nociceptors, which is a type of sensory neuron which is active when there is tissue damage, and is what causes the pain sensation, is traveling from the point of damage through the brain stem to the brain. So, while asleep, there is no brain stem connection to the brain from the sensory neurons, ergo no pain perception. You can think of it as connecting Christmas lights. When you connect one series of lights to a second series of lights, it will allow electricity to flow through both sets. If you disconnect the second series of lights, then the flow of electricity will only flow though the first series of lights. As opposed to 1998 when the undertaker slammed mankind through the hell in the cell on a 16 foot drop.

djy4065,"The Roadster is the best Sportster for sure. I've owned a LOT of big bikes in the past and I wanted something smaller and more suited to the style of riding I have time for these days. I've owned a Valkyrie, Gold Wing, M109R, GTS1000, VStrom 1000, Roadliner etc.

I finally had to be face reality of the style of riding I actually do. I really only have time for short 2 hour or so rides due to other commitments. With three kids at home including a 2 year old, the chances of me taking a super long road trip are essentially zero.

I love my Roadster and it's probably one of the better bikes I've owned. Even at 6'4"" I find it pretty comfortable, at least for my short rides.

My only regret is passenger room. My 11 year old son rides with  me a lot and even he comments on the lack of passenger room. My 15 year old won't go anywhere near the passenger pad. This isn't a fault of the bike since I knew that going into it but sometimes I wish I had maybe gone for a softail or a touring chassis bike. Right now, that would be the only thing that would get me off the Roadster.

A minor complaint is the rear turn signals. They are different than the other Sportsters as they cover the rear-most mounting hole in the fender support. This limits what sissy-bar / racks you can put on it. This is easily fixed by just switching to the standard tail lights.

Any other concerns I have about the bike are just general Harley/Sportster personality. This is my first Harley. I've almost had the seat screw vibrate out already. I had to sit in Seattle traffic for an hour last week in 85 degree heat and I felt like my chestnuts were roasting on an open fire.

I'm going to Japan with a group from reddit London all varying dates from the 8th - 27th. I'll be in Tokyo by the time you arrive so would be happy to hang out. I'll be there by my and self from the 10-27th roughly or doing things that I enjoy in comparison  to my friends.

1) How are you college apps going? Have you started/finished? Or were you like me &amp; chose to finish the day of/before it was due?

2) What colleges are you applying to or what colleges do you want to apply to?

3) What do you plan to study?

crnmaxa,"I recently had an issue with this very friend who presented that quote. Being a good guy, I let her borrow my car for a job interview with strict instructions to return it to the lot in which I paid for a monthly parking space (I live in NYC).

She neglected to do so, instead parking it on the streets of NYC for a month, racking up $700+ in parking tickets before I became aware (when I received the pre-penalty payment letters from the city). And then had the gall to ask to borrow the car again, apologize while trying to shift the blame onto me, and finally telling me she values our friendship.

No, XXXXXXXXX, You don't. If you did, you would have returned the car when and where you were supposed to. And failing that, would have informed me of the tickets. And failing that, would have offered to pay for the tickets. And failing that...etc.

Remember kids: someone who will take advantage of your kindness once will always take advantage of your kindness.",Wow. Just wow at that story. I cannot BELIEVE she didn't offer to pay the tickets?!!!! Ugh. What on earth was her justification for parking it on the streets of NYC instead of the garage?,,,
cbiq5dl,"As a woman with small boobs, you, sir, have my upvote",I like the 1920's style so having little 34b's is great. I can always add a bit more (wonder bra) if something doesn't fit right too. ,,,
c92n1uc,"Hi, 

So I met this really cool girl recently and we're meeting up again in the next few days, but I have no idea where to take her!

Hi People, im going to build my first gaming pc soon, been doing some research the last week and come up with the parts list above, does this look ok for my needs? im hoping to get some of the parts cheaper on black friday, thanks!","Yeah I realise that, I meant 1080 or 2560p, I understand 4K would be lower settings :)",,,
c1085j4,"I tend to play hardcore, meaning if I die, that's it. I've learned the following things. I've learned these from my YASDs.

* Beaches are prone to collapse, mining one tile can potentially cave in an entire beach.

* Never mine straight down once you're 50 tiles below sea level. You'll fall off the entire game world and die, and you'll never get your items back. Ever.

* In fact, don't mine straight down at all or you'll wind up in lava.

* Never engage skeletons in melee. They'll fuck you up bad.

* Don't go under frozen water, you wont break out in time without the right equipment.

* [](/creeper) &lt;- Avoid.","If you should happen to end up falling in lava, for the love of god get your ass back on some solid ground before you burn to death.",,,

cmog7x9,"Last night I googled suicide, as I sometimes do when I need to get meta about my bad feelings. One of the things that comes up in Google is this letter to people thinking about suicide on metanoia.com. This bit stood out to me last night:

""Some people will react badly to your suicidal feelings, either because they are frightened, or angry; they may actually increase your pain instead of helping you, despite their intentions, by saying or doing thoughtless things. You have to understand that their bad reactions are about their fears, not about you.

But there are people out there who can be with you in this horrible time, and will not judge you, or argue with you, or send you to a hospital, or try to talk you out of how badly you feel. They will simply care for you.""

It then lists numbers and organizations and etc.

It made me realize that this is exactly what I need and what many people need. Someone in their life to not freak out, or make them feel selfish or like a burden or pathetic or whatever. Depression lies and cheats its way out of companionship a lot of the time. But as true as that is - depression is still some kind of weird, uncomfortable taboo, and when I personally sit and think about the people in my life I could tap for help, I cannot think of one of them that wouldn't feel a) personally hurt, b) immediately burdened, c) scared and/or angry.

These are all reasonable reactions, I think. But they're not helpful. I long for some kind of quiet, understanding companionship and solidarity every day, knowing I can't ask for it, knowing that if it exists, I can't find it. 

I imagine anybody with very long term depression will relate to this, or maybe I'm nuts, idk. Thoughts?","If I even mention not wanting to exist, my husband wants to put me in a hospital.. Now I just lock more thoughts and feelings inside. I think it's making it worse...",,,
cudlqwq,"Haaa....I laff at u guys..I live in Lagos and the Nigerian police are brutal criminals..  When u see them, u run",fair enough. Never claimed that the police here are the worst in the world. Just that they generally don't help anywhere. ,,,

dq558ws,Cats are everywhere in England as we live so close together. Nobody really keeps their cat indoors as it's commonly considered cruel.,"right. so let them roam free--you've already killed off most of your wildlife anyway. 

this is the problem with cat people--generally speaking. they anthropomorphize felines to the extent that it disrupts everything and anything that might inconvenience and cause discomfort to their pet.  ",,,

Who do you want to be in spin offs? what locations do you want to see?","Cappy wouldn't be strange, imo. They could just put a cappy hat model over a kart model.",,,
cohu0ki,"Indirectly; Mastery Rank increases only when you rank up Warframes and Weapons (200 pts per Warframe level, 100 pts per Weapon level). So by boosting XP gain, you level your gear faster, which levels your Mastery Rank faster.

dj7ryic,"You need to figure some things out first.  Are you real-time transcoding?  If your players can already play the media you have without transcoding, you don't need much cpu horsepower.  My present plex/NAS runs on the G3930 (bottom of the line Kaby Lake).  However it has been background transcoding h.264 files so I'm looking to migrate up to a processor with AVX2, probably the i5-7400.  

As others have mentioned, I wouldn't bother with the 7350K.  That MB doesn't overclock and really, you don't need to bother overclocking a Plex system.  You want cool, quiet and stable.  

This is what I would do.  It's about $100 more than your present build, but if you go with the i3-7100 you can save a bit of money there (you'd go to 2 cores instead of 4 though).  I changed your case to the Fractal Node 304.  I know cases are a personal choice, but I like this one (it's what I use).  It holds up to 6, 3.5 hard drives in what is basically a large shoe box.  If this is to be a media server, having the expand-ablity here is good.  I changed the motherboard to that Gigabyte since it has 6 SATA ports (you lose one for the M.2 though I believe).  I traded your 5TB 7200 RPM drive for a 5400 RPM WD RED NAS drive.  For ""bulk"" storage, 5400 is ok and cooler than the 7200.

c4n5n4n,"Due to some health concerns my doctor has strongly advised against me using hormonal birth control any longer.  As the non-hormonal IUD has been ruled out for me, my only remaining viable options are barrier methods such as a diaphragm or condoms, or surgical methods.

I don't like the idea of using a diaphragm only for BC - I'm not particularly good at using it yet and I'm worried that I'm not getting it right, so I make my husband wear a condom also.  He is really not liking that at all and wants me to get a tubal ligation.

I've learned that a tubal is much more invasive, much more expensive (and considered to be voluntary surgery on my insurance so we have to pay out of pocket) and has much longer recovery time than a vasectomy.  The problem is that my husband will not get a vasectomy.  He says it's because they sometimes fail.  (The failure rate for vasectomies is just about the same as for female sterilization, BTW.) I am worried that he won't get one because deep down he hasn't fully let go of the idea of having children someday and if he gets ""fixed"" then he won't ever be a father.  I am 37 and steadfastly childfree.  He says he doesn't want kids but simply will not agree to a vasectomy.  Is this normal?  I really don't want to have major surgery if I don't have to, but my husband is really making it almost a necessity.","I'm not going to address any issues that might be keeping your husband from a vasectomy, but being childfree is a personal choice.  With it comes the the responsibility to yourself to ensure that your choice is carried out.  Do not rely on someone else for that assurance.",,,

d8emvuq,"I don't know what's happening to me. I've only ever loved girls, at one point I wondered how its even possible for someone to like a man, I couldn't understand it. I unfortunately hate myself every damn day now that I feel this way, like couldn't I just be normal and be a normal friend to my buddy.

A little background: I'm 22yo male who has never had a girlfriend, I've asked out a lot of girls and been in what felt like true love with a few, always to have been rejected. I met this 21yo boy about a year ago through a mutual friend, and he's part of a close friend group I have and one of my absolutely best friends. He's had 3 girlfriends in the past and other casual things with women and is straight.

I just don't know, in the early days of our friendship he used to always text me to come hang out and would get in long conversations with me, I want to say simply because we are like the same exact person. I've never in my life met someone who was just like me and thought the same way I thought. We became like best buds. 

Early on in our friendship he brought out a lot of ""gay"" humor when we hung out. He'd slap me on the ass and make jokes about wanting to fuck me (which alot of us in the group do at times). I thought nothing of it. But they would soon become more and more frequent, and eventually he just straight up started calling me cute all the time, and says this in a ""I'm straight but objectively I can tell you have a baby face"" type way. 

Well one weekend we went camping, and things got a little more intense I suppose.. one of the days when I went to leave he grabbed my face with both hands and kissed me on the forehead (drunk), the next day he randomly grabbed and hugged me (sober) and wouldn't let go for a while, and then one night all of us (except him) took acid and tripped:

He was trying to explain some deep philosophy and pulled me out to the field away from our campsite. We were having a really deep conversation about the universe (me on acid) and I was about to say something important so I said ""do you ever just feel.. do you ever just feel like"" and he interrupted me and quickly said ""I feel like it's about to be some gay shit. Like are we about to make out right now?"" 

Well the next weekend it got even more extreme when my two friends (straight guy straight girl) kissed me on the cheek when they were both really drunk and my friend in question saw this and immediately walked over, grabbed my face, kissed me on the lips and walked away. The next day we all hung out again and my other straight friend was fucking with me and touched my face but I didn't notice and I said ""did you kiss my cheek just now?"" and friend in question (who was 5 feet away) walked up to me and kissed me on the cheek right after as a joke.

I would dismiss all of this as straight friend-to-friend interactions. We're a very open minded group. And we all feel really comfortable around each other and are close. Being fake-gay is something we all do because its funny. I would dismiss all of what I just wrote, except for the NEXT night that now forces me to be unsure.

We had just gotten done talking about how I wanted to find a girlfriend (me and the friend in question and another friend), and my friend in question leaves to join the rest of the party. I go out to join him 5 minutes later and I say something like, yo how come you didn't come back inside? He turns to me (drunk) and says, ""Im sorry, I didn't"" and as he's saying this looks at me funny and then just grabs my face and gives me a kiss on the lips, turns around and that was the end of the conversation. 

I don't know what to do. I love him so genuinely.. he's my best friend and I've gotten to know exactly who he is, what he stands for, what he's passionate about and I've come to realize he's just so fucking special. It's so weird to me to feel this way, this man is my best friend, I shouldn't be crushing on him. But I can't help it, I don't see him as a male. I see him as a person. A fucking rad person. When I'm with him I'm happy af, and everything just feels right. When he's gone I think about him constantly. I don't want a gay relationship, it freaks me out. But for him I'd be willing to try things in secret and see what happens, in fact, I want that more than anything. I just want us to feel the same way.

But what if he doesn't. He doesn't seem gay and doesn't fall victim to any of the tropes. But god I've never gotten to know what it feels like to just hold someone you love and be held by someone who loves you back. And I'm 23. Like what's it like to snuggle all night with someone you love and wake up right next to them so they're the first thing you see in the morning? I want to feel that. And I can't get on with my life because I'm stuck with the most well-intentioned, genuine feelings for my best friend. I don't want to find someone else. Who the hell is going to be more special than him?

Where do I go from here.. I can't tell him, he'll either be weirded out, distance himself from me (probably won't because he's a great person), or at the very least ppl will think I'm gay and I'm not. If he doesn't share the same feelings, it'll destroy me. I've been rejected so many times, and every time it hurts more and more because I only ever get older, and the rejections just add on themselves. This time not only will I feel rejected, I'll also feel completely ashamed of myself. It really might break me. Because soon after I'll have to watch him date some girl and she'll hang out with us all the time and that will kill me.

But I don't want to sit here and not try. God forbid he feels the same way.. how sad it would be if we both could have been something and found out 20 years later when we were married. 

Any advice? Does its sound like he might like me too?","The part where you say couldn't I just be normal it's bugging me I know I should address some of the other thing in this but I'm not going to

c55l8i1,"So, I'll try to recap this to give some insight. I've been dating the same girl (""K"") for almost four years; she's my first LTR, first *real* girlfriend, first person I slept with, etc.  K on the other hand is older (25 vs 30) and very experienced (with both men and women), I'm just her first long term girlfriend and now her longest relationship. In the beginning it was like most relationships, attraction coming out the wazoo and having sex as much as possible. She was never shy or subtle and more than happy to make me be late to see friends or go to work. 

Here's the catch, I don't orgasm, ever. Now, I'm not asking for advice about this, I've done plenty of research and done just about anything under the sun to work on myself, and honestly I've never had one so it's not like I miss it. I'd rather enjoy the ride and give her as many as possible instead. Before we started having sex I told her, I don't orgasm and you need to go into this realizing it may never happen and that's ok if it doesn't. She said it was fine, hinting she could change things, and didn't foresee it being a problem. 

-Fast forward a few years-

It's a problem! I'm now ""the best sex"" she's ever had and she feels like utter crap because she can't get me off. K feels guilty, embarrassed, that she's a bad partner, that she's bad in bed, that she gets tired while I could keep going, and that she should know what to do after so long. I now get rejected almost any time I try to initiate sex, she almost never initiates but when she does it's so subtle that half the time I don't even realize what she's doing and then she gets upset that she was finally trying and I ""shot her down"".  Mind you, we have sex maybe once a month, two if I'm lucky. When we do manage to have sex most the time afterwards she just seems sad about the whole situation, no matter how much I tell her I enjoyed it. She used to want me to tell her what I like during, but now if I do she thinks that it's because she's doing something wrong. Her libido is extremely low now (because of the situation and some medication) while mine is still raging, so she also feels bad for that as well (seriously, I'm surprised she's not Catholic with all this guilt being thrown around). 

Now my questions for you fine ladies; do any of you have any clue about how to remedy this situation? Have you been in a similar situation? Nothing I say seems to help, but maybe I'm saying the wrong things? Am I doomed to make people feel like crap if I never orgasm? The whole situation is seriously wearing on us and negatively effecting our whole relationship. I want my partner back, I want someone to love and be loved. I want her to kiss me with passion again, not reluctantly for fear of starting something she can't finish.

UPDATE for those interested: 

So after posting this I took the advice and talked up how much I enjoyed sex the last few times we had it, how close it made me feel to her etc. Then, after reading this http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/wd78u/streamofconsciousness_on_sex/ I forwarded it to her saying how much I liked his ideas (I cut out the dick part).

Jump to today, she asks if I want to come home on my lunch to eat with her. I get there to her in lingerie on the bed  with the lights dimmed... lets just say I was super late getting back from lunch. From the best sex we've had to date. I tried to be super responsive and tell her everything she was doing right, how good it felt, etc, and boy did it help. We both walked away satisfied and I think she feels really great about it!

d5acrqy,"I work at a LTC facility and my management team approved the re-admission of a resident that we had staying with us prior; the resident's family had brought in bed bugs (that subsequently had to have the semi-private room fumigated multiple times) because we had a desperately low census.

A few days after the resident had been re-admitted, I woke up with small-ish red bumps disperse among my legs. One appeared one day, the next week maybe two more, in random spots; at the time I hadn't thought much of it, I definitely wasn't thinking of the resident, who I hadn't even provided care for (but was near my end of the hall.) I hadn't put together any sort of connection, the bites and the re-admission seemed innocuous and unrelated; plus, we could not assume the resident still had bed bugs.

Word got around that on Friday, two STNA's found multiple bed bugs in this same resident's bed when changing linen. Of course, contact precautions were initiated some time after and the word was passed around. 

Yesterday after work, I came home and took my scrub pants off to find 4 more, brand new bites at my ankles. This is when I actually became fearful. Around 2am I found a small black bug on the wall down the hallway from my bedroom. Tonight, I found the same sort of bug on a wall *inside* my bedroom. [This is the best image](http://i.imgur.com/F011oHw.jpg) I could find that looks like the bug I captured.

Tomorrow I'm going to contact an exterminator. Whether or not I can afford one or if they'll even be able to be effective is up in the air. I guess I'm just utterly frustrated at the situation.

ccv2z7i,"Hi everyone,

I've been over in /r/infertility for a long time, and never ever thought I'd be writing a post over here. 

A brief intro for anyone who doesn't know me: I am older, single, using donor sperm; I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, really high anti-TPO levels,  very low AMH (0.36) and high FSH (highest was 23). Diminished ovarian reserve. This year, I did 5 IUI's, and just completed my first IVF cycle.

For my IVF, my RE retrieved 5 eggs on 10/1, and transferred 3 embryos on 10/4 (day 3 transfer -- 6 cell). 

I did a HPT this Monday, which was 10dp3dt, and there was a faint line. I was stunned. I had already convinced myself it hadn't worked -- I mean, how could it, with an AMH that low? And nothing had worked in the past...all failures, etc. etc.

I did betas at two day intervals this week:

* 10dp3dt Monday: beta was 37. My RE was cautiously optimistic, (emphasis on the cautious).

* 12dp3dt Wednesday: beta was 114.

* 14dp3dt Friday (today): beta is 240.

Next visit is a week from Tuesday, for an ultrasound. 

I'm having a bit of a different reaction that I thought I would...I thought I'd be jumping from the rafters -- and I kind of am, but -- I'm also consumed with thoughts about how I will do this, as a single parent, etc. My family lives about 2000 miles away, but thankfully they are committed to coming and helping. I'm not sure what form it will take, or for what intervals, but -- they are great people and I'm very lucky they are willing to help. So that is easing my mind somewhat. But, my main emotion this week, aside from the joy and relief that this might have worked, is fear.

Thanks to everyone in /r/infertility who cheered me on over all of these months, especially during the retrieval and transfer process -- everyone was so supportive and amazing. I know many folks frequent both subs, and so I will say a big hello to my friends who are here on this sub, a big hi to the people here I don't know, and for anyone reading from /r/infertility: big hugs and thanks for reading this, and may everyone have a chance to make a post like this in the future.","Such wonderful news!!!

c8abepp,"I have an 03 Triumph Sprint RS and overall i love the bike.  Shes a sport tourer so she doesn't exactly have the looks or speed of a ""normal"" street bike, nevertheless, shes hella fun to ride and she gets the job done.

Anyway, my problem is that about 2 weeks ago, I had to pull over as my bike was on the verge of overheating, and when i eventually did, i had my radiator blow coolant into my overflow tank and eventually to the ground; hot liquid, steam, the works.  After self diagnosing the bike, i traced the problem back to a blown fuse for my radiator fan, and eventually a blown fan motor.

I couldn't find the exact fan for my bike, but i ended up mounting an even larger fan from a bigger triumph on to the radiator in the exact same spot as the old fan and hoped all would be well.  Turns out that wasn't the case.  The bike stays around 82C-86C when im cruising and at speed, but as soon as i stop for a red light, the bike's temp keeps rising and rising until I personally shut the bike off at 99C, as ive never had the bike go that high prior to the incident where it overheated. 

 The only other bit of information that might be useful is that my fan is ALWAYS running.  Its been like that for the 5 months ive had the bike.  I always thought it was normal til i did some research a week ago and realized there is supposed to be a relay that kicks the fan on when the bike gets to a certain temperature, and that one of the previous owners direct wired the fan to the battery, bypassing that relay.

What else could be the problem, and how might I go about fixing it?  I'd prefer not to take it to a dealership if its something I can do myself.  Between me and my friends, we have a great deal of experience wrenching, and ive got all the shop tools at my disposal.  As there is only one dealership in town that does works on triumphs and of course, they have ridiculously high prices.  They have me by the balls and they know it.","I agree with drive2fast.

He knows I watch porn/masturbate and doesn't have a problem with it but hates that I do that but never feel like doing anything with him. And I have a problem with that too. I want our sex life to be happy and fun and stuff so I figured that if I stopped porn then I'd be more in the mood for stuff with him. Okay anyways, to end this rant, are women welcome in this sub? I only ask because I mainly only see men on here (in the couple hours I've been lurking haha).","Welcome to the brotherhood, sister :)

dc8hqo0,"Delaware is roughly 30mi x 96mi, roughly 1,986 square miles. Rhode Island is roughly 37mi x 48mi, which is actually only 1,214 square miles after you account for water/etc.

So there are 1.63 Rhode Islands in a Delaware.

Assuming you mean the ice shelf, though...

&gt;Given that 1 sq. mile is 27,878,400 square feet, and then multiplying the third dimension of 1000ft (thick), this ice block contained 55,254,988,800,000 cubic feet of ice.

Quick Google has a cubic foot of ice at about 62.4lbs. 

End result is 3.4479x10^15 lbs of ice, or 1,723,955,650,000 [1.72 TRILLION] tons.

*But wait there's more...*

Your average adult male African bush elephant is 13,000lbs, which means this ice shelf weighs [roughly] 265,223,946,240 elephants.

That's a whopping 265.2 *billion* adult male elephants.

crpys8g,"Having worked as a data analyst at a couple of very large companies, I can tell you that management generally is not looking for advanced statistical techniques. They want to know where things stand at the moment, and where they might stand a little bit down the line. For that, basic statistical techniques like means and medians are usually sufficient. Your job is in dealing with messy data, rather than doing fancy things with it.

So the good news is that you probably already have the skills you need to do your job at a competent level. That's not to say that you can't become an expert at your job by adding additional skills. Knowing more about statistics or excel/database techniques will absolutely help you and make you invaluable.

* I'd suggest focusing on learning excel macros and start building some database skills.
* Also look into how to present data well—well-presented data is more useful than more-precise data imo. I'm a big fan of Edward Tufte myself. 
* Is a database important to the company? If so, perhaps you could manage that project to help make your life easier and satisfy a need while adding to your analysis experience. Get some SQL training or w/e the company wants to use. 
* Finally, get some good stats knowledge under your belt. This is honestly less important than the above. Knowing when to use a chi-squared regression can certainly help you give good answers once in a while, but I doubt that such knowledge is more useful to your bosses than the above. ","Thanks for the answer.

* I am relatively competent with most Formula's in Excel but actively learning VBA. I have recorded Macro's , but yes I realise I need to learn how to use them to automate the data.

* This is actually something that I have been really working on. I will look him up.

* Yes a Database is important. I do have a background in management and PM from a previous life, So I may well make this suggestion.

* Stats. Any recommendations on where to start? currently meandering through Khan academy.",,,

Usually people say ringing is sign you lost your hearing in one frequency, sometimes this ringing never stops.

In your case, just like mine, I highly believe your ears just need a break or it's a fluke which will go away. The thing that is likely happening is your ears out of mistake are accidently boosting the gain (gain is a thing your ear does so it can hear quieter sounds better). Then your ear kinda messes up a second and the amplification leads to ringing (sort of like keeping mic near a speaker it gets louder and louder until you move it away). However, your ear eventually fixes it.

This past month has been the BEST time I've had being off the meds. Although, this is the first time I've been helped off my meds by my psych too rather than trying to taper myself off or quit cold turkey. It helps to build a strong support system if you don't already have one. Particularly, a good friend or a therapist, or someone who can give you regular reality checks between what is happening in your life and how your feeling/responding to it. 

Also, Buspar is a class B anti-depressant and according to my psych, it is safe for pregnancy, so if you can't come all the way off meds, maybe you can look into this one as an option. All it did for me was take the edge off. (Which at the time was not acceptable treatment for me but may work for you.)

I know a lot of people suggest exercise and it helps too - I used to walk but I'm honestly too lazy to keep it up. So, as an alternative, I have a happy place that I go to when I need a smile or a laugh. For me, cat pictures... in particular, r/cathighfive and r/cats. 

I still have some bad days but between my support network and my cat pictures, I've been able to be med free for over a month now. It's not long but the risk of infertility due to the meds along with the unknown birth defects that are possible make me feel it's worth it to be med free. And should I have another really bad episode, I can call my doctor and get back on my meds stat as long as I'm not pregnant so it's good to have a fallback.

While I can attribute the last 15 months to me knowing it was time, there's one week in particular that sticks out. My fiance was about 4 months pregnant and supporting my addiction because she truly loves me and figured if she didn't give me money I was going to steal it anyway. We were flying to Arizona to visit her grandmother who was medically unable to fly, so I bought about 20 roxys and 30 percs a week prior to bring with me so I wouldn't be dting down there. Being an addict with no self control, i was all out by the time the flight left. On day 3 of being down there, I was probably the sickest I've ever been. So I borrowed her sisters car and went to a gas station in a shady area and waited til I found someone with scabs all over their arms and hands.

2: Work remotely with a US company that would have deep enough pockets to sponsor you if they like you.

3: Found a startup which will attract the attention of US VC, who can then help you out. (Hardest)

d2t5x9e,"I ordered two Samsung Wireless Fast Charger Pads from Newegg Marketplace (sellers: Always.Deals and ElectronicsPlus). First off, I ordered a black and a white fast charger. I received two black non-fast chargers, and they are both counterfeit. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/hi6h5) is the album of the products.

Notice that the boxes are two different shades of green, and the font on the bottom left is printed in two different sizes on each box. Further, one of the chargers has a weird white ring along the edge of the charger. Then on the second box, if you zoom in, you can tell the ink on the words is not even aligned correctly with the  imprinted letters. Besides that, the packaging and product both feel extremely poorly put together. 

That being said, Newegg is going above and beyond to resolve this. Just be careful ordering from the Marketplace.

EDIT: One seller responded and told me to keep the item and they'll provide a refund. Not like I wanted the item but I'm glad to see it's moving forward.

EDIT #2: One seller on the Newegg Marketplace refunded the money and told me to keep the product (which is useless anyway). The other seller is being difficult, but Newegg ensured that it will be resolved.

dclqipa,"You should build whatever you think you need. Really, if you see an item in the game, chances are you could build it on Jax and it would give at least something useful.

Triforce into Bork/Gunblade is the standard core, though recently Bork/Gunblade before Triforce is getting popular. Basically, Bork lets you split faster with more attack speed and gives you more dps and tank shred, and Gunblade gives you more burst and sustain. If you're splitting against a super tank, bork might be better, but against a squishy (Gangplank) or someone you need sustain to duel (Darius) Gunblade would be better. After 2 damage items, most people start building tank.

I would build resistances against whoever's the most fed on the enemy team, or whoever the enemy team sends to stop my split (usually the top laner). If there's a big Tryndamere on the enemy team I would get Randuin's. Fed Katarina means I'm building Spirit Visage. Gigantic Yi is healing for a billion health every auto? Try Thornmail.

cn0abii,"I really need some advice on how to handle this because I feel like it's getting worse.


My husband and I have been married for 9 years, together for 16 years. Like every couple we have had our ups and downs, but for the most part our arguments have never been over significant things. He's an amazing man and has always treated his family well.


Our son is 14 years old and entered high school last September. My husband always had high expectations that my son should join multiple sports teams and be an athlete, get a scholarship, maybe go pro ect. ect. Thing is our son never joined any sports teams and has no intention of ever joining teams.


He spends most of him time drawing and writing stories. He's said he wants to work in animation in the future. I fully support whatever desires he has and always have. My husband on the other hand thought it was just a phase and when he entered high school he would be more into sports. My son just really doesn't like sports and told his father that he wouldn't be joining a team.


Well his father freaked out and threatened to disown him if he didn't join a team come the next semester (winter). Now he's threatening to break his play station and take away all his art supplies! I think this is getting way out of hand. I've tried talking to my husband but he kept saying that I should be standing by his decision.


Please help me.. What can I say to him so that he might listen to reason? I don't think it's fair to force our son into something he isn't even going to enjoy.

tl;dr My husband is threatening to disown our son and break his things if he doesn't join a sports team

Edit had to fix some mistakes. And this is a throwaway because my husband reddits

**EDIT 2:** Just wanted to thank everyone for all the advice I'm getting and to let everyone know I am reading every single comment! I just wanted to clear a few things up to:

I never said I was going to side with my husband. In fact I said I don't agree with him at all! I would never let anyone force my child in to something they didn't want to do.

The second thing is no, my son is not obese / chubby. He doesn't enjoy sports but he loves other types of activities like hiking and biking and things like that. I think what he doesn't like about sports is the competitiveness of them.

I'm going to make it a point tomorrow to talk to him about why he is pushing our son to join a sports team like one person suggested. Just really sit down and talk to him about all this and where is it coming from.

Thanks everyone for all your advice!","Ok, this is just absurd.

So I am still a student going to Uni. My parents let me live with them still because my University is about a 30 minute drive. Anyways, It was a really stressful week and what better way to unwind than to bop my bologna? I had been sitting in my room trying for a while but kept being interrupted because privacy is a foreign word in my household. I decided I would go to the bathroom because my parents wouldn't bother to walk in on me handling my bathroom business. I figured since my parents were fiddling around with some electrical stuff in my hallway, I would go to there bathroom farthest from them in the house. Easy mission right? Do the deed, flush 'em down the toilet and we're done, right? Wrong. I also felt a  disturbance in my stomach. I needed to relieve myself in two ways now.  I had remembered reading a post once where someone said that shitting is one of the best feeling in the world so I decided I would try to shit and orgasm at the same time. It seemed like a great idea at the time, mostly because I figured it must somehow stimulate the prostate. 

I was ready to reach my climax. I had a shit queued up. As soon as I felt myself ready to orgasm, I pushed and sent my load of crap out. It was a strange feeling. I felt like I had left myself, but it wasn't entirely pleasurable. The horrible scene that awaited me when I came back to reality. 

I some how managed to send my seed all over my mother's beautiful floral forest wallpaper. Now this was shocking for me, mostly because I never really launched a load like that, mostly just gross dribbl- Never mind. Not only was the wallpaper covered, but my pants and underwear. I also noticed that I had diarrhea. Since my anus kept contracted as I orgasmed and I pushed out diarrhea at such a force, some of it ricocheted back at me hitting me, which isn't the end of the world, and also managed to somehow creep out from under the toilet seat and seep down the side. 

Reddit, please don't ever try to shit and cum at the same time. It's not worth it. No reward for a lot of work.



TL;DR: I tried to reach ecstasy, but only managed to send my seed all over my wall and have my shit seep onto the floor.

",AFAIK when you use the muscle to poop the other muscle down there that shoots the cum can't be used at the same time. So if you use your pooping muscle while orgasming you will shoot very far. I use this technique pretty much every day when masturbating. I almost always get surprised by how far I can shoot my load :D,,,

[UPDATE]  
Thank you all.  I live and was raised in Seattle and really have no idea about how to dress nice.  Sadly, I have also learned that Seattle has very few stores that actually provide suit attire.  I had to do some foot work and finally found a couple of places that want people to look good.  

I picked these sadly because they were the ""nicest"" shoes on the shelf at the store I went to.

Since then, I have gone actual shopping for a suit and decided to drop a bomb on a real suit.  I got real shoes, also.

dfdyjcx,"There are a million threads already about posting your dream games for the Switch, but I've noticed most people are talking about the same games. Is there anything you're hoping for that is being overlooked?

New games, ports, VC, and unreleased games are all welcome.

My most wanted game (if the Gamecube VC rumours are true) would be Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles for VC. I'm a huge fan of local co-op and character customisation - and if these two categories were on a venn diagram FFCC would fit perfectly in the center. I can't remember how the controls mapped to the GC controllers but I reckon they could even make it so you just need a joycon each to play in co-op mode.

Unreleased 3DS games such as Ever Oasis and Snack World would be awesome on Switch as well. So would everyone's favourite friendship-killer - Mario Party. Star rush on the 3DS should be ported ASAP, I know they probably won't as they don't want to cannibalise 3DS sales - but I feel as though anyone who is going to buy it on 3DS already has.

Finally, I believe that Switch is going to provide a perfect opportunity for the Monster Hunter series to make a comeback to consoles. I haven't bought a MH game since Tri as I can't bring myself to play it on such a tiny screen. I've tried all the demos and it's just to small. We *NEED* a western release of Monster Hunter Stories on Switch as well.

dlnszmj,"*Scroll to bottom for pertinent info and relating questions I have for you lovely readers.*

Me 4 days ago: I'm going to fast until vacation

Me after one day of the fast: lol jk

I'm not mad at myself for giving up or at least not as mad as I thought I'd be. The last few days have been painfully slow and would've been torturous when starving. But I am upset that I'm so goddamn bloated. I'm not upset that I've overeaten every day since my one day fast and the two days before it. I don't consider it binging. 

They told me in IOP that if a deer were in the woods and hadn't eaten in days and saw a bush of berries, it wouldn't just have half the bush for fear of lacking willpower. Extreme hunger isn't something I feel as much guilt for. It's binges when I haven't restricted that truly upset me. 

Regardless, though, I've still tried to lax/senna/whoosh my way back down to where I was before this week give or take a pound. It's not working. I have had maybe 4 lil rabbit turds this week and one big satisfying lax induced mess right after I broke my fast. I am so ridiculously bloated. 

Among others, my problem is that I will eat any food put in front of me. I feel like this has only gotten worse this relapse and it's fucking me over. I ordered a mini pizza at dinner tonight and wanted to only eat half but kept going to ""not be wasteful."" 

I'm going on vacation today for my birthday (it's on Thursday woo) and I am behind schedule of where I could have been. I want to try to lose weight on my vacation but it seems impossible. I've planned some long bike rides so hopefully I will go through with doing them. Constant eating out and birthday desserts are going to be testing my willpower and I need to remind myself it's okay to be wasteful. 

I can't wait for school to start. To be in the land of portion control, meal plans, meal prep, walking everywhere, and therapy. I want to be in a safe happy zone. I am so stressed out by my family. 

2 weeks until my appointment with my treatment team and I'm not going to drop all this water weight plus 5 pounds of fat. It's unrealistic but I'm lowering my expectations and hoping they will see this relapse in whatever number I am. At the very fucking least, I need to stay below 98 to be underweight. At the least, I need to be 95 to be what my doctor considered ""the lowest she'd accept."" I would very much like to be at 93 to have wiggle room. I'd love to be 90 to really worry everyone. I'd be over the fucking moon to be back in the 80s but I might actually start getting in trouble at that weight.

No matter what, I need their concern because my family sucks. I need validation to get back to being better. 

&gt;Questions: Best tips for getting this water weight to flow through me? I'm drinking more water but it's just sitting there too. What's a realistic weight goal to have for 2 weeks from now? Like how much of this ~4 pounds is realistically water weight?

&gt;Also, random but I was going to invite my mom to help me move in to my new apartment. We have a bad relationship and I wanted to be nice but she's already stressing me out about the situation (saying she'll hang around all day, making comments about my room being shitty, complaining about gas and time wasted, generally pissing me off) and now I want to uninvite her.

dmot0xm,"So, today I played my 10 matches to get a rank and I must say, I don't think I've ever been this angry about a videogame before. The first 3 matches were ok and I even won 2 of them. But after that, everything went downhill. 4 losses in a row because my team decided to either not stay on the objective and rush off or to quit because of unknown reasons (had a match in which 3 mates quitted and 1 where 1 mate quitted). The last 3 matches were also ok and I won all 3 of them. In all matches I played Zenyatta and got either gold or silver eliminations in every round, as well as gold healing and objective time. I ranked in as silver and I started to ask myself: Does Overwatch really only care about the wins/losses and not a single bit about the players work?

dpoc08a,"Ero nettotuloissa täysin työttömällä ja 1700/kk tienaavalla on 432,44 euroa. Jos oletetaan työläisen tekevän 160 työtuntia kuussa, saadaan laskettua työnteon taloudelliseksi lisäarvoksi 2,70 euroa / h. Osa ehkä silläkin palkkiolla tekee ihan mielellään töitä, mutta lienee selvää, että aika moni tuossa kohtaa mielummin jää sinne sohvanpohjalle.

Kannustinloukkuja vastaan taistelemisessa pitäisi tehdä sitoumus, että efektiivinen marginaaliveroaste ei voi ikinä ylittää jotain rajaa, esim. 50 prosenttia. Perustulo olisi luonnollisin ratkaisu. Tarveharkintaisia tukia on pakko poistaa, estää niiden päällekkäin maksaminen ja pienentää tukien aiheuttamia efektiivisiä marginaaliveroja. Esimerkiksi asumistuen perusomavastuu on lineaarisesti riippuvainen ruokakunnan tuloista kertoimella 0,42, mikä tarkoittaa, että pelkkä asumistuki nostaa efektiivistä marginaaliveroa jo 42 %-yksikköä.","Itse erehdyin tekemään töitä 1000e palkalla kuukauden, kun töitä satuin saamaan. Tämän vuoksi menetin 2000e toimeentulotukea.

Irtisanouduin työpaikastani välittömästi ja olen siitä eteenpäin saanut Kelasta rahat elämiseen ilman ongelmaa. Jos joskus satun +2000e/kk työpaikan saamaan, täytyy katsoa tilannetta uudelleen, mutta linja on hyvin selvästi se nykysuomessa rankaistaan rankalla kädellä jos tekee töitä ilman että nettoansiot ovat yli 2000e/kk.",,,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Triumph:** I believe in “Fake it ’til you make it.” Lately, when I feel nervous going into a social situation, I think, “How would I be acting if I had no self-esteem issues at all?” Just imagining that scenario helps me to feel more confident.

**Struggle:** I am feeling the end-of-summer blues. Kind of like after I hit my first year sober anniversary, when I felt my momentum was in danger of faltering. I guess I'll just have to plan what exciting thing to do next, to keep that forward-motion going.

**General:** What is the one song where, when you put it on, you just can’t stop your body from dancing? Mine is [Funky President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_ODghRTeyQ) by James Brown. 

","Triumph: took a hard look in the mirror, joined this sub, and meditated instead of drinking. Now for a cup of tea and a book I guess.

Struggle: had some tough coparenting-related anger to work through this evening.

But I know many prefer other things, so I'll post everything I find or that is messaged to me.

**THANKS** Thanks to everyone for posting. Really I have no idea what the fuck happened here today, I just wanted to find a couple new songs and you guys went fucking nuts. I have never seen so much great new music posted in one thread before. This  will take me weeks to sort through. I'll try and post the amazing far more inclusive playlists people made tomorrow. Don't just listen to the stuff posted up top, there is a shit load of great stuff buried in the comments too!  Thanks again. This is officially the greatest new music thread in the history of today. Let's do this again next month!!!? 
    
Here's mine: 
[IIRIS - Tigerhead](http://youtu.be/MDulSkBuJOo)  
  
I'm a married 30 year old with kids and I love this song...and not ironically...I legitimately love it.  
Post your favorite new music!   
   
I'll try and post the complete list below, if you posted a spotify track, or posted a link with no artist - track name, I may not be able to find it.    
    
   
**EDIT:** I tried to start listing all the tracks being posted but we got to 95 comments in 5 minutes, and I was all like [""...woah""](http://i.imgur.com/EtC4fyM.gif). I'll keep trying...but maybe I'll wait for a helpful Bot or something...I'm at work. Thanks for all the amazing songs though. I've seriously discovered maybe 40 amazing new songs today. You guys are kicking r/listentothis' ass right now.   
     
----
**EDIT 2:** Ya I completely gave up on making the list. I was expecting like..20 people tops to post. I have to get work done before I get fired. I'll complete the list and post a YouTube playlist later this weekend. Unless someone else wants to...I'll post your hard work if you do. I'm gonna go listen to the countless hours of awesome shit you guys just posted (and keep posting) Thanks!   
    
----  
**EDIT 3:** *Obligatory* O. My. Fucking. EFF! Frontpage. Kickass. Keep posting songs. Someone who is better at life will put together a youtube/spotify play list...I just know it...someone?....anyone?

Again, not an all inclusive list, looks like it just has the few I've managed to post up here. Trust me, there are A TON of much better, and probably less well known songs below in the comments. It's a gold mine down there folks! I just don't have time to post everything up here! Sorry.   
Alsol, again thanks to [u/ff248](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/20epdp/post_your_favorite_song_youve_discovered_recently/cg2mtac) here is a radd.it [PLAYLIST](http://www.radd.it/r/Music/comments/20epdp/post_your_favorite_song_youve_discovered_recently/).   
  
Again, I'll put together a more inclusive, official streamlined one later. Probably for both YouTube and Spotify or some other.

d1bvg3p,"So, you probably know that this discussion has been going on in the FNAF fanbase. Well, I'm here to say what we saw in FNAF 4 wasn't the Bite of 87, and there's a simple reason for it:

""Hello, hello? Hey, good job, night 5! Um, hey, um, keep a close eye on things tonight, ok? Um, from what I understand, the building is on lockdown, uh, no one is allowed in or out, y'know, especially concerning any...previous employees. Um, when we get it all sorted out, we may move you to the day shift, a position just became...available. Uh, we don't have a replacement for your shift yet, but we're working on it. Uh, we're going to try to contact the original restaurant owner. Uh, I think the name of the place was...""Fredbear's Family Diner"" or something like that. IT'S BEEN CLOSED FOR YEARS though, I doubt we'll be able to track anybody down. Well, just get through one more night! Uh, hang in there! Goodnight!""
- Phone Guy, Night 5, FNAF 2

See? It can't be the bite of 87 because the diner's been closed for years at the time FNAF 2 happened, which is '87. Now, you're probably going to mention the training tapes, and how Phone Guy said the springlock suits were used in the pizzaria:

""Uh, hello! Hello, hello! Uh, welcome to your new career as a performer/entertainer for FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA. Uh, these tapes will provide you with much needed information on how to handle/climb into/climb out of mascot costumes. Right now, we have two specially designed suits that DOUBLE AS BOTH ANIMATRONICS AND SUITS. So please pay close attention while learning how to operate these suits as accidents/injuries/death/irreparable and grotesque maiming can occur. First and most discussed is how to operate the mascots while in animatronic form. For ease of operation, the animatronics are set to turn and walk towards sounds they hear which is an easy and hands-free approach to making sure the animatronics stay where the children are for maximum entertainment/crowd-pleasing value. To change the animatronics to suit mode, insert and turn firmly the hand crank provided by the manufacturer. Turning the crank will recoil and compress the animatronic parts around the sides of the suit, providing room to climb inside. Please make sure the spring locks are fastened tight to ensure the animatronic devices remain safe. We will cover this in more detail in tomorrow's session. Remember to smile; you are the face of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.""
Training Tape, Night 2, FNAF 3

Yeah, they did exist on the pizzaria, but I have reasons to believe they were ""specially designed"", as Phone Guy said. Look at the FNAF 3 Fredbear minigame, where we have Fredbear and Spring Bonnie on the stage. Now, compare it to FNAF 4 minigame. The animatronics are kinda different, aren't they? That's because they are! They are different versions, with the same name (well, Fredbear was likely nicknamed Freddy in the pizzaria) but with different characteristics. Not to mention the ones in FNAF 3 look a lot more like Golden Freddy and Springtrap, which, by the way, were locked in the PIZZARIA'S safe room. After the springlock failure, Fredbear's (plus the bite, which also helped on this decision)  was closed and the costumes in Freddy's were sealed away:

""Uh, hello? Hello, hello! Uh, there's been a slight change of company policy concerning use of the suits. Um, don't. After learning of an unfortunate incident at the sister location, involving multiple and simultaneous spring lock failures, the company has deemed the suits temporarily unfit for employees. Safety is our top priority at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, which is why the classic suits are being retired to an appropriate location, while being looked at by our technician. Until REPLACEMENTS arrive, you'll be expected to wear the TEMPORARY COSTUMES provided to you. Keep in mind that they were found on very short notice, so questions about appropriateness/relevance should be deflected. I repeat, the classic suits are not to be touched, activated or worn. That being said, we are free of liability, do as you wish. As always, remember to smile; you are the face of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.""
Training Tape, Night 4, FNAF 3

I think those temporary costumes are the ones we see in the FNAF 3 final minigame, those kids that were sitting on the tables, the crocodile and whatever. They are like just normal costumes. The replacements sound like the main four we all know to me: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy. I also have a theory that Freddy is the first Fredbear, but then they decided to reform Fredbear's, and see ya later Freddy. 

HA! DEBUNK THAT!

Edit: It needs to be Fredbear's Family Diner, because in one of the teasers, it says ""Property of Fredbear's Family Diner"", plus:

""Hello, hello? Hey, good job, night 5! Um, hey, um, keep a close eye on things tonight, ok? Um, from what I understand, the building is on lockdown, uh, no one is allowed in or out, y'know, especially concerning any...previous employees. Um, when we get it all sorted out, we may move you to the day shift, a position just became...available. Uh, we don't have a replacement for your shift yet, but we're working on it. Uh, we're going to try to contact the ORIGINAL RESTAURANT OWNER. Uh, I think the name of the place was...""Fredbear's Family Diner"" or something like that. It's been closed for years though, I doubt we'll be able to track anybody down. Well, just get through one more night! Uh, hang in there! Goodnight!""
-Phone Guy, Night 5, FNAF 2

Phone Guy implies that the owner gave up after Fredbear's, it should be ""Property of Fazbear Entertainment"", if it is another restaurant.

czemca7,"So as some here might know JJ Abrams is seemingly a fan of Hideo Kojima. [The name Kojima is actually even shouted by one of the aliens in the opening scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lBtxlV7s4) The two have met on a few occasions and Kojima even gave JJ an early signed version of Metal Gear Solid 5.

In the game Metal Gear Solid 2, the game starts off with the player playing as Solid Snake, the lead of all the 3 previous games (Metal Gear 1/2, and MGS), the game then switches it up and the player then plays the entire game as a new character named Raiden. Raiden is a blonde rather girly looking man, as opposed to Snake's definitive masculine gruffness. 

To me this switch in the main character is actually exactly what JJ did with Rey in TFA. Not just the fact that she was the main character and not Luke or Han, but also the fake out that had Finn posed with the lightsaber. The trailers and ads for TFA definitely seemed to indicate that Finn was going to be the one gaining force powers, but this of course turned out to be a very Hideo Kojima style ruse to disrupt the audience's expectations. So we can already see from this how JJ is taking some cues from the MGS universe. 

In Raiden's mission he plays a very similar role to what Solid Snake did in the first game (fighting a terrorist organization with super powers, and stop Metal Gear). The plot twist comes that Raiden's mission was set up by a powerful AI system that was trying to create its own version of the now legendary Solid Snake. So all of the similarities were intention in trying to test Raiden and shape him into a soldier very similar to Solid Snake.

Now lets look at Rey. Rey's origin is actually very close to that of Anakin and Luke Skywalker. She is like Anakin in that she basically worked as a slave, grew to be very good with electronics and piloting, and like Luke she never knew her true parents. 

In fact in the brief flashback scene you see that Rey is *given* to the fat junk dealer. This is much more in line with Anakin Skywalker being sold to Watto. This is very much an intentional part of the plan to mimic Anakin Skywalker's upbringing. To give her a hard life that will fill her with anger and resentment later. 

I have a hard time believing that Luke or even Rey's mother would abandon her and give her to be raised by a man who doesn't have any good intentions for her. In a deleted scene, Rey is even confronted by the junk dealer for stealing the Falcon from him. She recoils in fear, but then Chewie helps her out and rips the junk dealers arm off.

Beyond that Rey shows a great deal of fear when confronted with the prospect of the force in Maz's cellar, and later when Kylo Ren assaults her for the first time. There is a lot of fear in Rey. ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering"". Part of her arc was overcoming this fear and confronting Kylo Ren. The novelization of TFA actually suggests that during her fight with Kylo she is channeling the emotions of the darkside.

The point of Rey being left on Jakku was to give her a childhood similar to that of Anakin Skywalker, to lead her on the path to the darkside by her learning fear and hatred. 

To further connect this back to Raiden, lets put a fan theory on top of a fan theory. Many people are speculating from Rey's natural force abilities that she had been trained in the force prior to being left on Jakku but then had a memory block put in place similar to Darth Revan from KotOR. Similarly Raiden from MGS2 had a history as a child soldier in Rhodesia, a memory that he too had block from his mind. Him being a child soldier was actually orchestrated in part to make him more like the Snake Twins, Liquid Snake being a child soldier as well. 

TL;DR: Rey was intentionally left on Jakku to recreate the conditions of Anakin Skywalker's childhood, just as Raiden was raised and given a mission to make him into Solid Snake. ",Holy shit that's a good theory...taken I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan out there but this definitely sounds plausible.,,,

the focus on a mirror is the same as the focus on the subject from behind the mirror, not the mirror itself

it's ok to google for inspiration, don't copy however, be inspired to do your own thing.

d9sn84v,"David Hume was a well-known philosopher of 18th century Europe that extensively developed upon the philosophical doctrines of empiricism. Empiricists rely heavily upon their experience as a guide to understand the world around them. Hume, more specific in his empirical views, developed causality; although this ideology has gained wide reception, it still holds limitations. To explain, causality is the relationship between ideas that allows you to infer knowledge beyond your immediate experience, with its limitations lying within its inductive doctrines and its infinitely regressive explanation.
	 To fully understand the limitations of causality, we must first understand its wider philosophy, empiricism. Hume divided everything into a subjective experience or an objective world. The subjective experience, according to Hume, is an interrupted, changing, and different consciousness. Let us take the physical paper you are reading these words on as an example. This paper exists in your conscious realm when any of our five senses perceives it. Now, say we were to take this same paper you are holding, place it in a sealed opaque folder, close the folder, then open the folder and take the paper out. We would say that the appearance of this paper leaving, then returning, to our consciousness would fall in your subjective experiential realm because our perceptions of this paper have been interrupted, changing, and different. Although we can make an educated guess about where this paper is at the moment we close the folder and if we are to stay purely empirical in our philosophic approach to this example, we cannot, with one hundred percent certainty, say that this paper is in the folder. Our consciousness now holds a gap of time where it could not fully account for the paper. Since we cannot fully account for this paper leaping into another dimension when we closed the folder and leaping back into our dimension at the exact moment we opened the folder to reveal the paper in the same condition as we left it, we must now create the theory of reality to explain what happens when we close the folder.
	The theory of reality, simply put, states that the objective world is relatively unchanging, uninterrupted, and the same. This paper will not be in another dimension, but in the folder because the reality of this paper, being in the objective world and not in the subjective experience, dictates that it is unchanging, uninterrupted, and the same. It only appears to us that the paper has disappeared because the limits of our perceptions cannot pierce through the folder. We live in a world of appearances, experiences, and subjectivity that are only part of reality. 
	Causality is the theory that between every idea is a causal relationship that can be defined as one idea causing another; a theory of truth by correspondents that allows us to infer knowledge beyond our perceptions. There is a cause and effect relationship between every idea and everything. To explain what can be considered a causal relationship, Hume created the three conditions of causality. The first condition being that 1. (A) must come before (B) or the cause must come before the effect. An effect cannot explain a cause, only a cause can explain an effect. The second condition being that 2. There must be spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity. Spatial contiguity by definition states that there must be a relative physical space between the cause and effect and temporal contiguity by definition states that there must be a relative time between the cause and effect. Lastly, the third condition being that 3. There is a necessary connection. There must be a logical connection between the cause and the effect. If two ideas conform to the three conditions of contiguity, then we can say these two ideas are causally related.
	Take the example of drinking a hot cup of coffee and burning your tongue. The question in hand is: what caused your tongue to burn? We will answer this question in the frame of Hume's three conditions of causality. First, does the cause come before the effect? In our example, you would first drink a hot cup of coffee, our cause, then have your tongue burned, our effect. Since we are attempting to explain why you burned your tongue, which came after our hypothesized cause that was you drinking coffee, this fits into the first condition of causality. Second, is there spatial and temporal contiguity? Since you brought the coffee right next to your tongue, we can say that the coffee and your burned tongue are spatially contiguous. Since your tongue did not burn minutes after ingesting the coffee but burned a second after the coffee touched your tongue, we can say that the coffee and your burned tongue are temporally contiguous; this now fits the second condition of causality. Third, is there a necessary connection evident between drinking a cup of coffee and burning your tongue? When you ingest material hotter than what your tongue can handle, the nerves in your tongue send signals to your brain that gives you a burning sensation. With this in mind, there is necessary connection with ingesting hot coffee and getting your tongue burned; this now fits into the third condition of causality. Now that we have proven that our hypothesized cause, drinking hot coffee, and our effect, getting your tongue burned, fits Hume's three conditions of causality, we can say that the effect was most indubitably caused by our, correctly inferred, cause.  
	The limitations to causality indeed branch from the limitations of its wider body of philosophy, empiricism. To reiterate, we live in a world of experiences. If we are just the embodiment of all our experiences and we are indeed only our experiences, by definition we can never step out of our experiences. Although it may seem that reality causes our experiences, it is in fact the other way around. Our consciousness perceives a reality by creating a similarity and coherence between our subjective experience and the objective world, causing the world as a whole to seem uniform. If we can never step out of our experiences, we can never prove that reality exists. Reality to the mind is an illusion and in fact does not exist. We assume that the objective world is unchanging, uninterrupted, and the same, but because we are holding an empirical philosophy to begin with, we can only rely on our experiences and therefore we cannot say the objective world of reality does not change, or even exist, because that knowledge does not lie in our experience. 
	Let us return back to placing this paper in an opaque folder. When we finally did close the folder, with this paper residing in it, we cannot say that we know for certain that this paper is in the folder because the paper no longer resided in our experience. When we opened the folder to find this paper sitting unchanged we assumed that the paper had always been there, but whether the paper was or wasn't there the whole time doesn't matter; the assumption of an unchanging objective world is the first incorrect empirically logical step. We cannot, with one hundred percent certainty, know whether the paper was ever in the folder because if we are bound only by what our senses can detect, then everything outside of our realm of senses can only be a probable guess at best. Hume was not incorrect in saying that objects are bundles of perceptions; objects are perceivable and experiential, but that is the limit to the theory of empiricism. Branching into the notion of a theorized reality steps out of the bounds of empiricism and assumes that what we think we know about the objective world to be correct. 
	If we cannot definitively prove that reality exist, how can we ever know that our experiences are coherent to the world around us? The answer is we can't. There is no such thing as a reality. If we were to open the folder and see this paper sitting in the folder but a colleague of ours, who so happened to be in the room at the exact time we opened the folder, wholly believed the paper had disappeared, none of us would be wrong or right. Both claims of the paper being there or not is a subjective claim about a non-existent reality, therefore any argument about the legitimacy or fallacy of the objective world is limited to the subjective experiences of the participant.
	Now, the limitations of the theory of causality are founded in the very ground of the theory itself. The third condition of causality is to broad a claim to be used as a proper inductive tool; no one at any point can account for the multitude of variables that come into play in any scenario. Furthermore, causality is based on inductive logic and so holds all the problems that come it; we are assuming that nature is uniform, which it is not.  Induction is only concerned with probabilistic claims, never with claims that are considered certain, for that would be a use of deductive logic. 
	The third condition of causality states that there was a logical necessary cause between the hot coffee and your burned tongue. This claim does not take into account the multiple other possibilities in this scenario that could have burned your tongue. What if it was the cup itself that burned your tongue? Or what if there was a bug inside your coffee that bit your tongue and gave the illusion of a burn? The possibilities are endless and yet the third condition states that there must only be one logical connection to determine that the effect was caused by the supposed cause. With many logical holes, the third condition unravels, taking causality with it.
	Another point, each cause creates an effect, then that effect soon becomes a cause for a new effect, and that effect soon becomes a cause for a new effect, and so on and so forth. So, if everything in existence can be explained to have a cause, then what created the first cause? For causality to work, there must have been something to create the first cause that caused all subsequent other causes. This uncaused cause, by causalities own definition, is theoretically impossible. 	
	On the subject of your burned tongue, we asked: what caused your tongue to burn? Our answer was the hot coffee you ingested. Now we could ask: what caused the coffee to be hot? Our answer would be the steamer that the coffee came out of. Now we could ask: how did the steamer get hot? Our answer would be that the steamer was plugged into an electrical socket. This line of questioning could go on and on until we got to the question of how the universe begun. Even if we took the big bang theory as scientific fact or even the existence of God as a theological fact, we would again have to ask what caused the big bang or what caused God. Since we cannot answer that question and any subsequent question we haven't even begun to ask yet, we cannot definitively prove that the first cause was indeed not an uncaused cause. We now must assume the first cause was indeed an uncaused cause because that would be the only way we could prove the hot coffee is what burned your tongue. In theory, causality holds limits to explanation and so it holds limits in practice.
	Causality and its larger branch of philosophy, empiricism, work to a point. The limits of empiricism fall in its assumption of a reality, which in turn cannot be proven. Because our experiences can be valid only to us, they cannot be used to prove a reality outside of our experiences. Causality is a theory that everything can be explained through a cause and effect relationship. Where causality finds its limits is in its notion that everything can be explained through having a cause. This theory doesn't work because if everything can be explained by a cause then there must have been an uncaused cause that created the first cause. Also, the third condition of causality is not a definitive claim that takes every possibility in every scenario into account, thus leaving logical holes in the condition. Although causality can be used as a tool to understand very minute aspects of how we experience the world, it is not an all-encompassing tool that can explain the universe as a whole.

d5v129v,"I've ridden mountain bikes my entire life, 99% of the time I was on pavement or asphalt. Same goes for the future, so I'm looking for a new mountain bike and I want to make sure that it performs nicely on the road. All I really need is suggestions.

The reason I'm on here asking and not looking myself is because I had a friend who got really invested in riding on the trails around town, and when he talked about specifics when it came to different types of mountain bikes, different this and that, it seemed like there would be a lot to cover when choosing a bike. I don't want to bother learning as much as I can just to make a purchase, know what I mean? He went head over heals to find something he wanted and it ended up being made of carbon fiber with 1 spoke at the front. Practically wet myself when I saw it.

Anyway I just want something light, smooth riding, disc (or disk?) breaks, lever gear shifts (not the stupid twisty ones) and that will last me a while. Wouldnt mind it  being to fancy either. Thanks","I'm not an expert but I think there's three basic things you need. First, hard tail because rear suspension will get frustrating after a long while. Second, front fork lock out to complete the full rigidity and response. Third, a set of road tires with some off road grib. After that pretty much any bike besides Wal-Mart crap. Be prepared to spend around $600. Trek, Kona, Giant bike brands are a good start. ",,,
dql23hd,"I work for a Fortune 200 company and I have been here for 7 years. I’ve been promoted twice and worked for 6 different managers and have a file full of glowing performance reviews, as well as other awards. I have a consistent, successful record of growing my businesses and I am supposed to have a great deal of autonomy. That being said, it’s not my company so I do have to follow directions but I am expected to speak up to protect my business. My current manager has been with the company almost 20 years in various roles and has been my manager for  about 1.5 years. She has a widespread reputation for being difficult and a bully, to the point that colleagues I only slightly know reached out to warn me when she was announced as my manager. I had already heard horror stories over the years, so I wasn’t surprised. It seems most of the company, including senior leaders, were aware of her behavior. I’m a sucker for the underdog, so I decided to give her a shot and make up my own mind.

Well, the stories were true. She’s terrible. Despite her years, she has a terrible grasp of the business and creates chaos. She bad-mouths co-workers, her direct reports, to each other. She lies constantly, sometimes to make her direct reports look bad to people outside of the team. Within 6 months of starting, she ran off one of my co-workers. Since then, I’ve become her favorite target. Some of it I’ve brought on myself because I will respectfully stand up to her if I feel strongly that not doing so will adversely impact my business. I have caught her lying to my teammates about me, specifically telling people that I’m not doing work I am responsible for when I have completed the work above expectations and she knows it. She will pursue her chosen path on handling business issues, even when told by higher ups not to, causing misdirection to me. When this falls apart, she does not step up to accept responsibility and throws me under the bus. She will tell me to do something then later berate me for doing what she said.

About a year ago, I had a tough conversation with her about these issues when she asked for feedback. I also went to her direct manager and my mentors with the issues to protect myself. Her direct manager also had issues with my managers behavior that he had observed, so he escalated to HR. I went through everything I was asked to do and was told by HR that my manager’s behavior was bullying and was unacceptable. The HR manager also said she had numerous documented issues with my manager’s behavior. It was inappropriate for either of them to tell me about these issues. At this point, it was escalated higher in the organization to the Ethics &amp; Compliance department and an official investigation was opened. I was told that my manager’s behavior was an issue and that action would be taken. She would be undergoing private coaching lessons with an outside party.

After this, I heard that my manager filed a complaint on her manager that she was being treated unfairly. My manager was closely tied to the Vice President of our division and quickly the tone of discussions changed. I was called into a “Conflict Resolution” meeting with my manager, where it was apparent that it was now being framed up as a personal conflict. After that, we were not allowed to discuss her behavior. My manager maybe attended one coaching session and her behavior did not change. 

So here we are, 1.5 years in and I continue to have great business results, but I can hardly drag myself to the office because she is in my face everyday and it is affecting my health. I’ve been cut out of meetings and communications that I was included in before, so it feels like I’m being punished. I have a great job and this is the first real problem I’ve had with the company. I would hate for her to be the reason I leave, but it feels like that’s where this is going. I did voice my feeling that my manager had not improved when a high level HR manager asked and I have voice the same to others when it’s been brought up, but there’s been no follow up. After I spoke to the high level HR manager, my manager’s manager suddenly had a list of grievances against me that he had my manager deliver. These grievances were “gray areas”: he didn’t like my tone, he didn’t like something I said even though it was true and professional, etc. This was a big divergence from him as he had always  spoken to me directly and not had criticism prior to this. This all just feels so wrong and is very much against the company culture. I’ve gone as far internally as I can without risking repercussions. 

I guess my question is could I possibly have a case. I can’t continue like this and want to understand if I might have any recourse if I face further retaliation for bringing the issue back up. The company is not going to fix the issue on its own and while I am the most affected right now, she also has/does bully others. I understand that I need to see a lawyer for specific legal advice, but I’m hoping y’all can tell me if it’s even worth considering. Thanks.","Being an awful person is not illegal. However, the treatment you are now receiving could be considered retaliation for filing a complaint, and retaliation IS  illegal. Get an employment lawyer and make sure to say 'retaliation.' Get that list of gievances from your manager's  manager printed out and date it. It will show that once you complained, all of a sudden a list came out.

cvrkl5a,"So yesterday I thought I'd try out the black Halloween whopper from burger king. A nice novelty but nothing special abbout it besides the color. 

This morning I am opening the restaurant that I have been a manager at for the last two months.  The owner of the restaurant is usually here early in the morning and this is my first opening shift so its really important that I do not mess up as the owner is the only person here.  After getting some work done i excuse myself to the restroom and to my shock and horror. A bright green monster crept from my anus. Appalled, I immediately busted out my phone and searched green poop on google and find a bunch of news articles about how the black whopper causes comically green turds.

The first few weeks I was there I kept to myself and just cleaned up the house a bit while my husband and his mom were working.

czaa6ha,"Reading the webcomic and learning Garou's true motivation for becoming a supervillain gave me a weird sense of deja vu, which I couldn't pin down until I reread Alan Moore's Watchmen. That's when I had my realization; the basic plot of Garou's arc and Moore's graphic novel are extremely alike!

The main antagonists of both works share an uncanny resemblance with each other. Both pride themselves as Gods among men unfettered by morality and the status quo, both are disgusted by the selfish and self-destructive urges of humanity, both are dissatisfied with the puerility of conventional heroism, and both eventually unleash monsters to save the world from its greatest adversary: itself. The only difference between the two is that while Ozymandias was more reserved in his antiheroism, Garou transformed himself into a caricature of monstrosity, deliberately becoming the target of mankind's hatred in a brutal attempt to reform it and its heroes. This may explain the Satanic visage of his penultimate and final forms, revealing his pretensions of personifying ultimate evil.

Taking all this into consideration along with other parallels (those between Saitama and Dr Manhattan deserve their own post) and shared themes, is it possible that Moore was one of ONE's inspirations when he drew up the oddball world of One Punch Man?

With an online password you only have one (know), so the requirements need to be a lot stricter to compensate for not checking off the other two types of security.",This is a simple and really effective explanation of security types. Thanks. I'm going to steal this alot. ,,,

cj73m8m,"There are two reasons: 


1: you will fail to complete your reps. If you can only complete 5 of your 8 reps, keep that weight. When you can do 8, move up. That being said, it's very dependent on your routine.



2. You feel like you're going to get injured/you have bad form. These are not mutually exclusive. Lower weight in this case.



Additionally, adding weight is most of the time a HUGE mental task, even more so than physical. I'm sure many lifters have experienced that they put on additional Weight on accident, and didnt notice until after. I've also had the weight be 15 pounds less accidentally, and It felt just as enduring to me. So there's no shame in trying new weights, dont be afraid to fail. Just don't try a new weight, only get it up with bad form,
An then decide that's your new weight.



Also, that ratio seems kinda off. Although my dips are a bit better, I do pull-ups and dips with 100lb weight added. You can probably go higher on the pull-ups.","I agree it's a mental task. One time I mistakenly did a pair of 90lbs incline db press thinking that they're 75's.

cypawip,"Your husband sounds ""absent""... no sex, no affirmations.. I couldn't live like this. When it happened to me (not because of porn though), I just couldn't stand it. I'm not as patient as you are and I certainly wouldn't feel guilty about someone neglecting me, though I might feel regret that I allowed it. I checked out emotionally and started the moving out process. After a few days, my SO came to me and said, ""I'm not going to let a relationship of 20 years end like this."" I didn't even respond; I was done.

After that, my SO became like a different person. TBH, nothing short of that would have swayed me. My initial response was, ""WTF, where WAS all of this before?"" I had no idea my SO had those kind of seduction skills. I'd never seen it before, even in the beginning of our relationship. 

There's much more to this, but I don't want to go on too long. The reason for my db was that my SO has a personality disorder and yours might too. I recommend you learn about the different ones and see if something jumps out at you. That will give you an idea of how much improvement might be possible. For instance, if your husband is a narcissist, I wouldn't hold out too much hope for change.

In any case, he has an addiction. You're not the problem, so don't take it personally. That said, there is no reason for you to put up with it.. none. If I had ever been with someone who threw me over in favor of porn, the first time it happened, there would not have been a moment of normalcy in the house until the issue was fixed, in other words, a no tolerance policy, just as most people have concerning their partner cheating on them.

So if your husband says he wants to change, but can't, then what? There is something you could do to stop him masturbating to porn. I'm not a dom and I've never done anything like this, but you could put a cage on it. Just look up cock cage. Then you could unlock him daily to use up the energy he previously used on masturbation. After a while, he would be habituated to you instead of porn. You might say, if you have to do something like that, it means you're not wanted and it's not worth it. But since he's been addicted to porn since before you met, he might not even know how he really feels about you yet. I wish you the best of luck, and remember, you have nothing to feel guilty about. Hugs!

(edit) BTW, I'm not anti-porn; it can be great for getting revved up for sex with a partner.    ","Thank you for sharing. I never used to be anti-porn either, until I started realizing how it affects people. I do look at it in a different way now though, especially the more I read about pornography addiction. ",,,

d1l15n8,"So, a few months ago my younger cousin and I decided to dig out his mom's old Ouija board, an old one made of dark wood. The planchette was made of the same or a similar wood and the eye was made of thick glass. We live together, as we go to the same college, so we usually do this kind of stuff. We turned off all the electronics in the house, including our cell phones, put the board in the center of his coffee table, lit a candle at each corner of said table and started using it. We both come from a spiritual family, and had always been warned not to use Ouija boards because they always invite freaky shit. While we were using it, we got boring mundane answers for usual questions such as when we would die (we both got 50 to 60 years), who the spirit was (which is something you aren't supposed to do, but we didn't know this at the time), and finally we put it away. except we forgot to dismiss the spirit. After this, weird things started happening. We started hearing random tapping from random places in his house, scratching on the walls and ceiling in the kitchen, and the shower curtain being opened and closed randomly. From there, my record player would start playing randomly, but it would play the records backwards. We were often woken up by whatever record i had left out, which was usually Led Zeppelin IV, playing backwards. It was unsettling, but it wasn't terrifying or anything. Just weird. One weekend, we were sitting around playing xbox when my cousin went upstairs to use the bathroom. While i was waiting for him, I heard a loud, inhuman guttural growl from the bathroom. My cousin screamed and ran back down stairs, his pants still around his ankles. I thought he had made the sound or played some weird soundboard through the speakers we had in the bathroom. turns out, while he was on the shitter, the shower curtains had been torn off of the rings. When I say torn, i mean the curtain was ripped clean through. After the curtain had been torn down, something growled from in the tub. From there, we decided enough was enough. We took the Ouija board into the woods behind the house, doused it in lighter fluid, burned it, buried what wouldn't burn, and smashed the eye of the planchette. For a while, things calmed down and the strange shit stopped happening. Fast forward to yesterday: We decided to make a McDonalds run because we were both too lazy to cook, and when we walked outside and locked the door, we saw what was left of the board had been dug up and that the eyeless planchette was in the center, the glass sprinkled around the board. My cousin and I are the only people who knew about the board and we are the only ones who knew where it was buried. We buried the board again, this time deeper and at a spot deeper in the woods. We're both shitting our pants and have no idea what to do?

TL;DR: my cousin and I are dumbasses who forgot to dismiss the spirit we were talking to, and now it's haunting us. What do?","You need to be cleansed, the house needs to be smudged by a person qualified to do it, and the remains of the board should be placed in an iron box with a cement block tied to it and dumped in a running body of water. I'm serious, and you should seriously consider following my advice. Leaving the door open to the spirit world is Pandora's box. Anything and everything can happen. Be blessed, and good luck to you.",,,

cous6br,"Hi all:

I submitted a story to the Missouri Review, on a whim--I'm an undergrad and I have only written a total of five stories. This was my second submission to a lit mag and I knew 99.99% that it would not get accepted. However, I did receive this encouraging note with my rejection:


Thank you for sending us ""Gemmabot"".

This story is a great commentary on the posthuman, especially how it questions whether or not one can truly ""transcend"" the individual (and this theme is nicely highlighted during the Jeopardy sequence, when one of Gemmabot's answers is ""individuality"").

Unfortunately this particular piece was not a right fit for Missouri Review, but we were very impressed by your writing. We hope that you will feel encouraged by this short note and send us something else.

We look forward to reading more.

Sincerely,

The Editors of Missouri Review

d7qvo9h,"Ive been in a happy relationship for 5 years, but thats because my GF is the best person in the world and much better person than I am. When we first started dating I had a problem with looking at porn and messaging random people and talking about personal stuff I had no business talking about outside of our relationship. Amongst all of it was a post about me being unfaithful.

She caught me, and was kind enough to forgive me. That was almost 2 years ago and things have been rocky, but getting better ever since. There was another flare up about a year ago when she saw I had a twitter account that was mainly for porn and she didnt take kindly to that. I deleted it and she forgave me again and told me I was skating on extremely thin ice.

BUT, since Im a self destructive masochist I had to go and start snooping around online in secret again. One thing leads to another and I start to IM and respond to some posts I see. Despite me knowing that this is just opening a black hole and that Im going to get caught again. It's inevitable. Especially bc I gave her all of my passwords to help her begin to trust me again, I wanted to be as open and honest as I could be.

Sure enough, she texted me this morning unleashing hell on me. I dont know why Im so self destructive and selfish. I try so hard not to be elsewhere. i cook for her and clean for her every day and try to help her with her school work and everything possible as often as i can to try and compensate for being such a POS when it comes to our intimacy.

Ive inadvertently offended her a few times by kind of projecting my own flaws when it comes to making love out into the open and onto her. and she doesnt deserve that at all because she has been so kind to me and helped me grow as a person so much. I love her with all of my heart and I cant believe the ways that I have hurtt her and that it has happened more than once.

II truly cant picture my life without her and I love her so god damn much. but I also have set our relationship on fire and have given her every reason in the world to doubt me because Im such a fucking slef absorbed jerk. I dont get how I could care about someone so much, but then have such a disregard for her feelings and respect but only in this one way.

it's so god damn frustrating not being able to get out of this awful habit despite trying to do it for so long now.

Ive been to a sex therapist and been to r/pornfree and have had good results there. but for some reason I cant stay on the right track. I can make tons of strides in the right direction adn then i just implode and self destruct and fuck up everything that I care about.
I love her more than i love myself, yet I keep on fucking up and I think today might be the day she breaks up with me. I hate myself so much. Im devastated and feel even worse for her because she's the sweetest person in the world and I have hurt her feelings so much with my selfishness.

I have a hard time talking about intimacy with her because of what Ive done in my past. and I think thats the biggest reason why i talk to strangers instead of her, because Im afraid of bringing up hurtful memories. but instead i just create new ones and drove her away from me

what sucks the most is that its not even the porn. Its the messaging and conversation that i cant quit. I have this urge to talk about taboo things with other people because im afraid to say some things to her. Im so scared of my own thoughts and shit that I repress them and then act on them in the worst ways and create this awful cycle of pushing her away by pushing myself away form acknowledging how i act in secret.
________
TL;DR - despite my best efforts I cant handle intimacy properly, and can only go 1 step forward before i take 2 steps back.","Live your life the way you want. Don't let people control how you act.

I've just received the sad news Be Broadband will be sold to Sky.
Be was my isp for the last 8 years and I was very happy with them but there is no way I'll stay with SKY.
Can someone suggest a good ISP, UK based of course, with similar terms of BE ? (Real unlimited ,no speed throttling etc etc).

I had a look at comparison websites but they look very biased ,so I rather have some feedback from Reddit

d1zab89,"This has been a long time coming. I've relapsed again and again and again.

What did I do? I had a taste of sobriety, getting 6 months in 2013 (only through shock and embarrassment though). I relapsed hard that Christmas and eventually joined SD in October 2014. 

It changed everything. I read and read so many posts and got involved, but this was my only source of support. I relapsed a few more times, after a few months sober, I thought I could moderate (big mistake) and felt the shame of coming back on here, tail between my legs, but no one made me feel bad for it, no judgement was passed on me, I was given advice and support. 

Last Easter I relapsed yet again and I remembered some advice that I had read time and time again on this sub, ""what are you going to do differently this time?""  I realised I couldn't do it alone.

I tried an AA meeting. I had nothing to lose. It was great, meeting people in real life, who were just like me,finally I wasn't alone. I learned how to listen, really listen. I still go, but to be honest it's very rarely, but that's what works for me right now. 

I also found, after many attempts, a good therapist, who has helped me with a lot of personal issues.

So with more lines of support I carried on, checking in here every day. The check-in, I love it!! It's what grounds me. I make a decision to stay sober just for 24hrs and it works for me, it's a goal I can actually achieve. Rinse and repeat!!

My life certainly isn't perfect now I'm sober, in fact life likes to kick my butt on many occasions, I'm a single working parent with 3 kids and I get lonely, some days just crying my eyes out, but I know it's OK to feel sad sometimes, because those feelings pass, they are fleeting. I am actually happier now and more emotionally stable and available for my kids, I'm more present for them. I'm more reliable than I've ever been. Life is so much better for me sober. It's up to me how interesting my life is, I am the one in control now and I haven't been able to say that in a very long time!! 

I love this community and have everyone on SD to thank for my sobriety today.

Overwatch Pros (Leetaejun, Zunba, and Haksal) Being Scared of Vansquad:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xrXctTlAGY

Vansquad is the hottest issue in the South Korean Overwatch scene right now. He's ranker in the Korean server who just has so darn good aim with widowmaker and mccree and because of that, people thought he used aimbot. To verify that he's didn't use an aimbot, in streams by Leetaejun (former Lunatic Hai player), Leetaejun invited pro players to play 1v1 against Vansquad with mccree or widowmaker and Vansquad actually beat the crap out of so many pro players and proved he wasn't using aimbot cuz when looking from his point of view, the trajectory of the mouse looked natural (as in the pointer didn't immediately go towards the head or the body in a straight line but drew a natural curved line) and he started to go bad in aim after playing for so long.

The even more cool thing is that he is so secretive (he never streams and never showed his face) and he's actually just a regular salary man in 30s who plays overwatch for fun. He even was scouted by various pro teams but he rejected them cuz he just wished to just live a normal life.

He also mentioned in a stream that he had been playing FPS games since 1998 when he was 13 year old. He was apparently quite well-known for his sniper talent in such games as CS:GO and Quake. Pro players also widely acknowledge him to be a genuinely talented player.

His style of play with Mccree and Widowmaker is also very unique. He somehow secretly gets behind or above the enemy team and assassinates each one of them while moving around without the enemy team noticing where that shot came from. In most of the videos of people playing against Vansquad, they keep shouting ""where the heck is the mccree!?"" ""I got sniped by Widowmaker from our back!"" ""I got killed by Mccree! He came out of nowhere!""

Also, after Vansquad revealed in Leetaejun's stream the mouse he was using, that mouse got sold out.

I'm in the beginning stages of a paper. 16 &amp; Pregnant, I think, did a good job in representing the struggles of getting pregnant young and having to learn how to be self-sufficient. As the show evolved and the spin-off's progressed, it's no question that the heart of the show has shifted from education to exploitation. It's become no longer about real people but about celebrities and audience pandering.

Chelsea failing her GED is real. Young couples breaking up is real.

But earning a 6 figure income at the ripe ol' age of 24 isn't at all realistic. Red carpet premieres and millions of instagram followers is something the majority of REAL teen mother's in the US will only experience in a fantasy world.

dkx5jsb,"When it comes to annotating reports, journal articles, etc. Do you prefer to use a tablet/hybrid? a large monitor? pen and paper (and scan later?) or a mix?

Many years ago I bought an iPad for that purpose. after a few months, it ended up being relegated as a media device. annotating on paper was quicker, and flipping through pages faster.  However it seems these days both tablets and pen input improved, and software much less cumbersome. There are also viable hybrids such as the surface pro now.

Any thoughts?","I know lots of people who swear by annotating paper copies and have huge folders of printed out articles with lots of scribbles on them.

df2ke1l,"Way back when, I used to work as a bank teller.  One day a man in a suit comes in and comes to my lane.  I had never seen this guy before but he looks like a million bucks, nice suit, perfect hair, the works.  No sooner does this gentleman walk up to me,  my manager asks to borrow me for a second and pulls me off to the side.  She told me that this particular guy was the richest person around and had 100's of millions banked with us.  She told me, ""If it isn't against the law, I want you to do WHATEVER he tell you to.  If he asks you to jump, you don't even ask how high, you just jump like your life depends on it."".  

Now keep in mind that this was all maybe 3 feet away from said Mr. Moneybags, and he obviously heard the whole thing.  So, my manager walks off to the corner to stare daggers at me, and I get to work.  

After doing everything (all normal transaction stuff), he looks at my manager, then me.  He then says, loud enough for all to hear, ""Oh, and you can take the rest of the day off, that won't be a problem, will it?""  The look on my manager's face was priceless! She couldn't say no to him because he's the center of the universe in that area and she (and the bank) knows it.  So, I get my stuff and walk out with him.  

Before I left he told me to let him know the next time he comes in if I got in trouble.  When I asked him why he did that, he said because he hates how everyone bends over backwards to treat him like a king, just because he has money, and my manager was one of his worst offenders.  

So, I got a free 1/2 day! My manager wasn't too happy with me for not coming back after he left, but I never did get formally reprimanded! 

Edit - wall of text 0=)

Edit 2 - Hey all, just wanted to clarify a few things. I understand that some people are skeptical, it's kinda over the top. That's why I wanted to share it. 

I didn't mention that I counted out my drawer because I kinda thought that was obvious. I would have been fired immediately if I just ""walked out"", no matter who said I could leave. 

I also admit I should have been more specific here, but that one guy didn't have 100's of millions in our bank alone.  He was the son of the man who owned the company that pretty much owned the town I worked in. So when I said he had 100's of millions with us, I should have said he and his company or something. That was my bad. 

Also, my coworkers were just fine with it. It was a small town, we had maybe 30 people come in a day at most. 

Sorry for the long edit, just wanted to clear up some legitimate concerns I saw.

cne61rh,"Jim laughed out loud, hearing the familiar sound bounce off the walls in the empty hallway of his grade school. His laugh was like all of his laughs, devoid of humor and instead full of loathing. In the short walk from his bike to the main doors of Valley View Elementary school, someone had managed to see his rifle and lock down the school.  

He couldn't pull off a successful school shooting, something even fucking nutcases could do. He walked down the hall, looking into each classroom through the glass panel as he passed the doors.  

""You couldn't even shoot fish in a god damn barrel!"" He yelled to himself. His voice again echoed off the walls and came back to him, the voice of God assuring him of his failures.  

Jim turned to a wall covered in children's hand prints made of various paints. He aimed his AR-15 and squeezed the trigger.  

As the bullets poured into the wall, he screamed along in a primal sound. He lowered the gun and looked at the damage.  

""Hi.""  

Jim jumped back and turned to the left, raising his gun at the source of the voice. It was a little boy, wearing a red and white hat with a green logo on it. He had a small ball in his hand, also red and white.  

""No hats in the hallways, Jim!"" Jim yelled at the boy as he held the gun at him. ""Take it off now or we'll call your mom!""  

The boy took off the hat and held it in his free hand.  

""Who are you?"" The boy asked. ""Are you a teacher?""  

Jim looked at the boy and then to his gun. ""How the fucking Hell do you not realize that I'm not a teacher?""  

The boy shrugged.  

""You look small to be in first grade.""  

""I'm in preschool,"" the boy said as he lifted his arm holding the red and white ball. ""But I'm going to be a Pokemon master.""  

Jim lowered his gun. ""Preschool? This shit-hole used to be a fucking grade school. They changed it to a preschool?""  

The boy shrugged again, lowering his arm.  

""How don't you know? I just told you it was a god damn grade school, if you're in preschool here it got changed. Yes or fucking no, kid.""  

""Oh."" The boy said.  

""Oh?"" Jim raised his gun again, aiming for the boy's chest. ""Fucking oh? How about a god damn answer, boy!""  

""My name is Jake.""  

Jim froze. After a moment he lowered his gun. ""Your... name?""  

The boy nodded.  

Yes, of course he had a name. Why wouldn't he have a name. Jim closed his eyes and thought hard.   

They all had names.  

""Well, boy- Jake, why aren't you in a room?"" Jim asked.  

""I was drinking water. Ms Erickson said I could go by myself."" He said back.  

Jim nodded. ""Which class is yours?""  

Jake pointed to a door that Jim has passed earlier. Apparently he missed the kids in that room. Jake started to go towards the door, but stopped when Jim put a hand on his shoulder.  

""Get out of here, you won't want to be here for this.""  

Jake said nothing as he began walking to one of the exits, putting his hat back on and turning it backwards.  

Jim walked to the door and raised the gun.  

He kicked the door in. A sea of faces stared at him from the corner. These kids were terrified, like Jake should have been. Maybe they were smarter, or maybe they just saw their teacher's fear and echoed it.  

Jim raised his gun at the group. He hesitated.   

They all had names.  

After a second, he backed away and dropped his gun. He began running back the way he came and out the main doors. He unstrapped the pistol from his belt and threw it down as he ran out. He also unstrapped his knife and threw it down.  

Before it hit the ground, Jim heard a loud pop and fell to the ground. He grabbed his chest, but he couldn't figure out why. Looking up, he saw at least a dozen police cars barricading the way out. His bike was gone. Someone had stolen it.  

Jim lowered his hand and was surprised to see it was covered in something red.  

""Officer,"" he said, but he couldn't hear himself over the police screaming something all at once. ""They stole my bike.""  

Jim felt his weight increase and his head fell to the ground.",Bravo! Loved the utilization of the names and how it made him recognize their humanity.,,,

Mount Aurora was the highest peak of Caeli’s Spine, a mountain range that stretched all the way from the Boiling Sea in the west to the uninhabitable glaciers of the Frozen Plains in the east. 

As Andromeda began her descent, a smell of ashes and scorched rock found its way into Leera’s nostrils. The smoke was thickening with every passing moment. Soon, the bow was no longer visible from the stern, and the mast disappeared like a spindle into the whirling yarn of smoke.

Leera coughed and buried her face in the sleeve of her tunic. Her eyes were tearing up, and a strange feeling was stirring in the pit of her stomach – one that she couldn’t quite place. The smell and vision-hampering whiteness reminded her of some blurry event from a distant past – she was choking, dragging herself over a hardwood floor, fires everywhere, Aelar’s hand pulled her up. It felt like certain doom awaited her if she looked at the memory too long. She shook her head. 

Bryne was standing on the bow with a cloth over his mouth. The wind was blasting through his hair and, in a way, it looked like his head was on fire and that it was the source of all the smoke. And maybe it was – Leera certainly wouldn’t put it past the man. 


A mountainside suddenly shot out from the mist on Andromeda’s starboard. Leera gasped and tripped over her own feet. She landed on her butt. An arm’s length to the right and the ship would’ve been splinters and toothpicks. 


Trembling, she glanced over at Quick. The old man had attained a look of rocky resolve, and the usually round and soft features of his face were now competing with the mountain in firmness. She noticed that he only had one hand on the rudder; the other was, unsurprisingly, clutching a teacup.

Leera closed her eyes and rolled to her back. Her nerves couldn’t handle the stress of looking at the mountainside rushing by. Silently, she prayed that the old man knew what he was doing. 
*****
Gradually, the air became easier to breathe, and soon Andromeda came to a halt. Leera opened her eyes and sat up on the deck. She looked at Cloudrest for the first time. 

Massive spires of marble sprouted from the mountainside, but they were all scorched and in ruins. The streets that connected the spires were carved from the solid rock of the mountain and looked like huge balconies from the side. There had once been parks, open air theaters, and artificial lakes on these terraces, but all the trees were now black husks, and the water was a mucky soot-soup.

“What happened here?” Leera whispered.

“To me, it looks like a dragon turned the place into its personal merry-go-round,” Bryne said.

“A dragon?”

Dragons were the stuff of fairytales. There hadn’t been dragons in the world for thousands of years. At least that’s what Leera had always been told.

“This was no dragon, Master Teller,” Quick said and steered Andromeda onto one of the terraces. “This… this is the work of men.”

The ship landed with a splash in one of the black lakes. Without the smoke, the views would’ve been breathtaking from up here, Leera thought. Right now, it was like looking into a swirling cloud. 

This terrace appeared to have once been a sanatorium park. Overturned basins littered the scorched lawns, and the lake had served as a public pool. Tables for open-air massages, with their covers still flapping in the wind, lined the mosaic road of the promenade that ran along the very edge of the cliff. A row of blackened skeletal trees had once provided the place with soothing shadow.

Something hung from the trees. Leera blinked, trying to make sense of what the strange twisted objects had been before they turned into coal. Maybe they were some kind of–she stopped herself. One of them had a face – burnt, glaring, eyeless, and skinless – but a face nonetheless. There were dozens upon dozens of corpses slowly swaying from the trees. She turned away in horror.

“W-what are we doing here?”

“If you could just stay here, that would be best,” Quick said and got off the boat. “I need to… make sure of something.”

The old man grabbed his cane and limped away, clearly undaunted by all the bodies dangling above him. Within a few moments, he had been swallowed by the smoke. Leera looked at Bryne, who hadn’t been smiling for an unusually long time now. She found herself liking him a lot better without that stupid smirk.

“What?” he said.

“Who would do this?”

Bryne shrugged. “Someone went through a lot of trouble to make it look like fire folk.”

“What makes you think it wasn’t?”

“Well, for one, we’re quite far away from Ignis.” Bryne heaved himself off the boat. “And, two, we’re on a mountain – a fire-bender wouldn’t even be able to get up here… much less an entire army of them. And I guess the same thing goes for the water folk, so that leaves two options…”

“Two?”

“Yep,” he said and strolled over to the first tree, pulled out a blade, and started scaling the trunk. “Stay on the boat.”

Leera glared at him. I’m not a child, she thought, you can’t tell me what to do. She got off just to make a point of it. Her legs were still wobbly from the perilous descent. She followed the fence of the terrace in the opposite direction of the trees. She didn’t belong in a place like this. All she wanted was for this nightmare journey to be over.

The promenade arched around the mountainside, and a massive staircase led up to the next level of the city. Smoke billowed out of a ruined building that had probably once served as some sort of checkpoint. Leera ran her fingers over the rough surface of the façade. The inside of the building was nothing but a heap of charred rubble.

Something was sticking out from under the pile. Carefully, Leera climbed over the smoking debris and lifted a piece of mortar. It was a porcelain doll. It looked just like the one she’d once had. Again, she saw herself on the hardwood floor of a burning building. Aelar was pulling her arm. She was struggling. She didn’t want to leave her doll behind.

“Scream, and I’ll put a bolt through your neck.”

Leera flinched and spun around. A tall woman with caramel skin and jet-black hair was blocking the entrance to the building. She was training a hand-crossbow on Leera.

“W-what do you want?” Leera whispered, looking at her feet, feeling the weight of her mistake sinking in. Why had she left the boat?

Leera looked at the woman again. She had never seen anyone clad like her before. Her right leg and arm were sheathed in straps of hardened leather, while her left leg was only covered by a thin layer of fishnet. She had a blade on her left hip and silver ribbon shaping her hair into a ponytail.

“Come on,” the woman said and tossed a set of manacles at Leera. “I don’t have all day.”

Leera suddenly felt the need to sit down or run away – one of the two – but there was no other way out of the ruin. She looked at the manacles. She felt herself sweating. She did her best not to start bawling. Her lip wobbled. She was about to be hauled off somewhere. Killed, sold, or worse… she thought about the dangling corpses in the trees.

“You are a pretty little thing, aren’t you?” the woman said.

“I saw her first,” Bryne said, and the edge of a blade appeared right under the woman’s chin.

For a moment, the woman locked eyes with Leera. She seemed disturbingly calm. A smile crept up on her face.

“Look out!”

Leera’s warning came too late, and the woman gracefully somersaulted backward and, in the process, kicked the blade from Bryne’s hands. She drew her own sword and disappeared from the doorway and Leera’s line of sight.

For a moment, Leera stood there, frozen in the smoking building. Then she took a trembling breath and ran outside. On the way she picked up the manacles, thinking she could perhaps use them as a weapon. 

Bryne was on the ground with a red gash across his cheek. He had no weapon, and the woman was closing the gap. He kicked out at her once – she side-stepped with ease. Oh, no, she’s going to kill him, Leera found herself thinking.

She stabbed. Bryne rolled, barely escaping. It was only a matter of time before she would land a fatal blow, though. In a panic, Leera looked around for anything at all that could help her – she found something.

“Stop!” Leera cried and aimed the woman’s own crossbow at her.

“What are you going to do, girl?” she said without turning around. “I saw it in your eyes; you’re no killer.”

“G-give him your sword – my uncle taught me how to shoot,” Leera said, hoping she’d get away with the bluff. “Bryne, take it!”

“Bryne?” the woman said, and hesitantly handed over her sword. “Is that you? I didn’t recognize you in that ugly haircut.”

Bryne took the blade and looked at the woman. He smirked.

“Violet?”

“Violet? What do you mean *Violet*!” the woman cried and threw up her hands. “It’s me, Maya!”

“Huh, I could’ve sworn your name was Violet…” Bryne said. “You know, it’s getting hard to keep track of all the women in my life.”

“Do you know her?” Leera said.

“Yes, he does,” Maya said.

“Aw, I’m not so sure I do – we best put those shackles on for safety.”

Maya snorted and shook her head. “So, Bryne what do you do these days?”

“These days?” he said, rolling up his eyebrows in feigned surprise. “I’ve always been the most respected tattoo artist in Brimport!”

“A tattoo artist?” She laughed. “That’s cute.”

“What is she talking about, Bryne?”

Bryne just smiled deviously and put the manacles around the tall woman’s wrists.

“So, a tattoo artist, huh?” Maya said as Bryne pushed her towards the ship. “That’s hardly a well-paying profession, how do you make that work?”

“By being responsible and economical.”

“You’re the worst person I’ve ever met when it comes to handling money!” Maya held her ribs as another fountain of laughter poured out of her. She turned to Leera, who was still trying to understand what was going on. “Did you know, he once lost his purse and all his food to a pack of migden bandits, isn’t that right, Bryne?”

“I swear, they’re a lot smarter than they look!”

c4fshrg,"&gt; It's basically ranting. But here's the thing, she NEVER tells me what she writes to him or what he writes to her (is this bad?). 

No, it's not bad. She needs a place to vent and I wouldn't show you either if I was her. When we vent, things get said that could easily be taken out of context on paper.

Her friend's feelings about you are merely a reflection of what SHE tells HIM, though. A girl who has zero problems with you would defend you to death to any friend who tries to start shit.

So if the gay friend is constantly talking trash about you, it's because all he ever hears about you, from her mouth, is negative. Don't blame him; he's just defending a friend who's badmouthing you.

czd0rjn,"Long time lurker here, been Keto-ing for almost a month, down 15 pounds, feeling great.

Based on a lot of other similar posts I've seen here, to that statement I can expect to hear loudly and clearly that ""a lot of that is water weight"". My question is why say that? For a lot of folks like me, that initial loss feels SO ENCOURAGING. It's like ""this thing I haven't been able to conquer for so long is CONQUERABLE!"" But every time someone comes in after a few days or weeks, someone has to burst their bubble by telling them about the water weight, then that comment gets upvoted so it's prominent and loud.

I get that there's a danger in someone assuming they'll continue losing at that pace, then falling off the wagon when it slows. I do, I get that. But until the post says something like ""WHAT HAPPENED!? I was losing 10 lbs a week, and now I've slowed to less than TWO!?!"" I don't think we need to be in the bubble-bursting game. In fact, if we DON'T burst that bubble after week 1, then telling someone about the water weight can be encouraging instead of discouraging. 

""Your weight has slowed down because that first week was almost entirely water weight. You're still doing great!"" feels so much better than ""Slow down fatty, you haven't really lost that much weight... that was mostly water.""

This community is amazingly supportive, so I'm absolutely sure it's no one's intent to burst bubbles or make people feel bad. I know that everyone is trying to help here. I just think it may not be obvious so I figured I'd point it out.

Just my $0.02 - keep on ketoing on.","Because its...true?  Losing water weight is still losing weight.  You're less bloated, your clothes fit better, it's still progress and should be appreciated for what it is!  Allowing someone to believe it's fat loss though is ultimately counterproductive.

d39jomo,"Just want to tell my story and see if anyone else can relate on some level or another.

My life was pretty normal up until shortly after starting secondary school. There I progressed to having bad anxiety which caused IBS(self diagnosed). Every single school day I would dread. I would often stay up late reading just so I wouldn't have to go to sleep and wake up to reality. Basically, I had anxiety about having anxiety which caused IBS. Should I have told someone? Probably, yes, but was too embarrassed. 

Although I had a lot of friends at school, no one knew the daily struggle I went through. I was very good at hiding it since I had been going through it for so long. I did often contemplate suicide, but hated the thought of the pain my family would be put through. 

This carried on for the next 5 years of school until I finished and decided to go to college so I would have something more than a few GCSE's to my name. I stopped talking to pretty much all of my friends from secondary school, and since my college class was quite small, I didn't hang out with any of my class friends outside of school. My anxiety carried on into college, but was a bit more manageable since I was only in several days of the week. 

In second year of college, I saw what university had to offer, and was excited to move away to a new city and make new friends. This was the best decision I could of made since I made some friends for life, and my anxiety has settled to much more manageable levels.  I have changed a lot over the last two years, and have discovered a lot about myself that I didn't realise before.

Although my anxiety isn't the bane of my life any more, I find myself struggling with different emotions and feelings. Mainly, relationships that I've had with other people, which for one reason or another didn't work out. I think this is most likely due to not having any intimate relationships before university, which resulted in me not being able to handle them as well as others seem to at my age. 

I often turn to alcohol as a way of taking my mind off these feelings. Recently, after a drunken fight with someone I have strong mutual feelings for, I gave up on life completely and was ready to end it. Luckily I had friends around to stop me. I know these feelings were greatly amplified by being intoxicated, but I find myself thinking back to them.

What's the point in everything? I lack motivation to do work, I find myself easily distracted. Is falling for someone really worth it, knowing the risk of heart break?

I know this rant is all over the place, but I just typed what came to mind.

Thanks for reading.
","I've experienced a lot of the same things you mentioned. I've avoided relationships for years bc I can't handle getting hurt again. Just met a girl and she just let me know today that she is going to start seeing someone else exclusively. It hurts like hell and is bringing back all the emotions that I'd suppressed.

Not only that but the last few shots were very ominous, making out there is more to Ted/showing a darker side to him...the last shot even alluded to him behind bars","What if it was Hastings that tipped off Hilton but in a different way to Jamie?

d9lyv5h," Cat shit will make you go crazy. 

There's a parasite, which is excreted by cats in their feces, called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii or Toxo for short) and is the microbe that causes toxoplasmosis—the reason pregnant women are told to avoid cats’ litter boxes. Since the 1920s, doctors have recognized that a woman who becomes infected during pregnancy can transmit the disease to the fetus, in some cases resulting in severe brain damage or death. Healthy children and adults, however, usually experience nothing worse than brief flu-like symptoms before quickly fighting off the protozoan, which thereafter lies dormant inside brain cells.

The “latent” parasite may be quietly tweaking the connections between our neurons, changing our response to frightening situations, our trust in others, how outgoing we are, and even our preference for certain scents. And that’s not all. The organism contributes to car crashes, suicides, and mental disorders such as schizophrenia. When you add up all the different ways it can harm us: Toxoplasma might even kill as many people as malaria, or at least a million people a year.","I you haven't vaccinated your cat or let it live in a garbage dump, yeah... maybe. We've had cats all our lives and we are all fine. ",,,

cy5tirc,"On my birthday, my wonderful boyfriend took me to this fancy Brazilian restaurant, where after the meal I ordered a Spanish Coffee (brandy, Kahlua, and coffee). I took pictures and put them on Facebook for my friends to see. The next day, my boyfriend's amazing family picked us (bf and me) up from our house to their house for a surprise birthday party for me. I had had no idea they were going to celebrate my birthday, but we had tons of fun, delicious food, and some Fireball in our after-dinner coffee. So I took pictures and put them on Facebook again. On the way home, my boyfriend stopped by Target, and we got a bottle of pink moscato that I was going to take home to my Nmoms house since I have to stay with her for the week, and she called me an alcoholic for ""drinking so much alcohol just because [I'm] 21.""

dp71my0,"OKAY so let's try to actually be helpful instead of moralizing. People should be nicer when folks come in asking for help.

You're 35k in the hole and you put aside 1100/mo (I find that unrealistic over the long term but hey). You have no assets.

Red flag one: 

&gt;and the government penalizes me every six months on top of monthly interest

Have you spoken to the CRA?? this should not be happening. Give them a call and explain your sitch - they are actually rather understanding, and can work out a payment program for you.

--

OKAY, so the downsides of paying off the debt is… you need to have some kind of financial cushion and your expenses are likely to go up. What if you need to move, or your rent goes up? If you're unable to get a better job, then a repayment schedule of 4 years seems more likely.

In terms of credit, that's already kinda shot and it's not like you're gonna get a downpayment to buy an apartment anytime soon. The only downside I can think of is potentially harming your ability to secure housing or certain classes of jobs in the future.

It seems like the only question remaining for you is as follows: if you can get a consumer proposal how much can you reduce your debt by AND is that number higher than your bankruptcy surplus payments?

At a glance a consumer proposal might be able to reduce your payments to the low hundreds of bucks per month; but on the other hand you're below the bankruptcy surplus income threshold, so a bankruptcy might be cheaper.

In summary:

1. Call the CRA!!!

2. Do the math and pull the trigger - but i agree that working for 3-4 years without any savings whatsoever is not a great idea.","Thanks for this - you're right about the penalties, they're yearly, not every 6 months.

dkifncl,"I have received this idea from another Redditor, please do not credit me for this. Instead of having a PVP match session between the bases of several players, one person could be the story teller while the other is constructing a colony. The objective of the story teller is to wipe out the opponent base using a tool box of various events found in the game before his adversary launches his spaceship. Of course, there would be a cool down time for particular events. Perhaps after using a raid, malaria,  and a heatwave in a quick session, the story teller must use at least a certain number of positive events and wait for the cool down to end for the negative ones.","That actually sounds pretty cool, almost like a dungeon keeper concept, the storyteller has to give positive buffs I turn for points to spend on negative events...

This week on IGQA, Inside Gaming recovers from the madness that was Pax East. I wonder what madness is going on in Joel's hole this week.

PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT QUESTIONS AFTER THURSDAY. YOU WILL BE SUBMITTING TOO LATE FOR A QUESTION TO APPEAR IN THE EPISODE. IT IS POINTLESS TO SUBMIT AFTER THE SHOW FOR THE WEEK HAS BEEN FILMED.

Don't forget to check out the new IGQA!

Rules:

You can only ask one question per post. Don't have a very long question, but please explain yourself to avoid being vague, but don't drag on in your explanation.

Communicate with the other people submitting questions. Up-Vote or Down-Vote the questions you like or dislike, so the best questions can be answered, and the bad ones can be filtered out. Comment on the questions asked by fellow Redditors and discuss the question freely, we want to know what you guys are thinking. If you think a question has been asked before on a previous IGQA, say something. Don't spam posts or over-comment on a discussion that is basically finished.

The IGQA's are a place for a polite and meaningful discussion. Please be kind to the hosts and your fellow Redditors, we're all friends here. Avoid asking ""meme"" questions, and stick to the good stuff, we're here to talk about subjects seriously, with a little humor on the side.
Please use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. A properly-written sentence is much easier to comprehend than a lazily-written question. Proper grammar is highly preferable to bad grammar, proper grammar is easier for the hosts to read and understand, while bad grammar only causes confusion, and your post will probably be down-voted.",If Adam was a girl in any game what would he be?,,,

djfu4rj,"Teacher checking in. I agree with you. I try to tell my students why they need to care about the subject I teach and how that affects them. 

There seems to be no guiding presence at home to stress the importance of school.

And then there's the problems with school itself. I can't teach them advanced things or nuianced things, because their base knowledge is so lacking. I mean, can't do basic math or read at grade level. I'm forced to teach a specific curriculum that ignores student interest and what could be valuable to them. I'm evaluated on how well they can answer test questions that don't necessarily test their knowledge. And it's sad to say, but there are a number of people in teaching who do not know their subject, or don't work well with kids, or are a combination of the two.","Yeah, it makes me sad that the education system is kind of shitty.

d27swkb,I love this joke so much because I once dated a girl like that. Said she wanted me to surprise her with sex while she was asleep (to wake her up) and asked why I hadn't yet. I hadn't heard that Louis joke yet but it was more or less my response. ,This is really weird. My ex asked me on multiple occasions to fall asleep inside of her.,,,
d4qp5mi,"I had my crossbow trained on the bushes before I even managed to fully wake up. I'd always joked that I could kill a demon in my sleep by now, but I was just using it as a turn of phrase. Apparently it was true.

""Show yourself,"" I told the quivering bunch of leaves across the clearing. My legs were still encumbered by sleeping furs, and extracting myself while still keeping my hands on the crossbow and my eyes trained on the target was proving more difficult than I'd imagined. ""How'd you get past my wards?"" I'd carved protective runes into every damned tree in this forest, any one of which should have been enough to do some good damage to any demon or hellbeast trying to get the jump on me. At the very least, it should have woken me up.

The figure emerged from the bushes, and I realized why none of the defenses were triggered. Lucifer, the King of Hell. I threw the crossbow aside; it wouldn't work against him. At least, it hadn't the *last* three times that I tried to kill him. He seemed the same upon first glance, but as he approached I could tell that something had changed. His magnificent crown and jeweled scepter were gone. He wore a simple black cloak, ragged and riddled with holes. And he was *terrified*. 

""Hello again, Monsieur Baudelaire."" He was still trying to project the same air of confidence, but he was checking over his shoulder every other second, and his hands shook against his sides. The arrogant grin on his face quaked as though it weighed a thousand tons and it took every last muscle in his body to maintain the facade. ""How goes the hunt?""

He knew damn well how the hunt was going. He certainly would have heard if I had managed to kill the demon I'd been after for the past two centuries. I'd racked up a pretty decent count, but never the one that I wanted. ""Get on with it,"" I growled to him. ""What are you here for now?""

He came closer to the fire. ""Well you're certainly a man of action, no doubt about that."" There was a wound on his shoulder that seemed to be smoking slightly. ""I have an offer for you. A deal,"" he continued. The same thing he'd said that rainy Wednesday afternoon as I knelt over my daughter's grave. I would have given *anything* for the powers to find the ones that had killed her, and all he'd asked was my soul. A small price to pay.

""I've got nothing left to give you,"" I told him. ""Unless you're ready to give up Corson."" That, of course, was the creature that killed Marie, and one of Lucifer's most powerful lieutenants. That was my original demand, but Satan had explained that there are some deals that even *he* didn't have the power to make. But he'd been quite amused at the prospect of letting me hunt down Corson on my own, and apparently there was no rule against that. 

""That's just the thing,"" Satan explained. ""That's precisely why I'm here.""

We stared at each other for a moment. Demons, you can never trust. But the King of Hell was bound by some fundamental laws, and could only *honestly* seduce men with promises of power and wealth and whatnot. I gestured toward a log for him to sit, and threw some more fuel on the embers to get them going again. I could at least hear him out. 

""Corson,"" he started, ""Has gotten a bit... self important, let's say."" I snorted. Understatement of the century. Every scrap of intelligence I'd managed to gather about the bastard all pointed the same way: he was a smug, pretentious egomaniac. ""And he... ahem... has taken over Hell.""

The logs in the fire crackled and popped a bit as I absorbed the news. I studied Lucifer's face. I knew he couldn't lie to me, but... could something like *this* be real?? Then I laughed. A long, raucous laugh that echoed through the forest and sent birds fleeing into the sky. I hadn't laughed like that in *centuries*! ""Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow,"" I told Lucifer in between peals of laughter and gasping for breath. ""You really know how to pick your friends.""

""Yes, thanks. I'm well aware of the irony of the situation. God said pretty much the same thing when I went to *him* for help with this little bit of insurrection."" That made me laugh even harder. What, exactly, had Satan expected? That the still-loyal Angels would rally around him? ""Look, I'm not *proud* of this,"" he continued. ""I need your help.""

I managed to calm myself down, though a few snickers still managed to bubble out. ""All right, all right. What's your offer, then?""

""Two hundred and thirty one years ago, you sold me your soul in exchange the gifts to hunt down Corson and exact your revenge. And all I want is to... you know, help you along a bit. If you bring me his head, then I'll give you your soul back."" From nowhere, he summoned what looked like a twirling diamond of light so gossamer thin that you couldn't even be sure that it really existed. It looked like it was straining and fighting to escape his palm but with no success. 

I'd never seen my own soul before. Even when he took it, it had just vanished and I could only *feel* the difference. The aching cold in my heart.

""Keep it,"" I finally growled. ""It's already pretty tarnished."" I didn't need *Lucifer's* help to get Corson. Especially now that I knew where he was. 

Satan gave an exaggerated sigh, back to his confident self for just a moment. ""I thought you might say that."" In his other hand, he summoned a second soul. This one looked more like it was made of a cloud of vapor lit from within. It was light blue, with an intricate spiraling pattern. The demons all say that each soul looks different. ""If not for yours, then how about I also throw in *Marie's* soul? For your daughter? Would it be nice if she could go to Heaven like she deserves?""

Her soul danced across his palm in a delicate ballet, just like my little girl used to do. ""All right,"" I whispered through tears. ","well damn.. you win my friend, I got chills at the end",,,

c501sff,"I have done a few dual boot setups and they have all been fairly easy thanks to linux.

Right now I have Linux on raid1 (1tb) and windows on a **separate physical** HDD that I can boot into if I want via Grub.

You can also partition your drive(s) and install multiple OSes on the same physical drive.

A boot loader like grub should search and find all OSes (Parttioned or Physically separate) and supply you with a list on boot. If it cannot/does not find all OSes you might need to add them manually (google that sh*t).

So, Yes, you're gonna ~~need~~ want to install a boot loader, Grub and Lilo are the most popular and linux can install both of them. (I think Grub is better)

You should also be aware of your BIOS setup on first boot device, set your main HDD (which *should* contain grub) as the first boot device.

Also I'm not sure what setup you have but you may also need to look at the way that the HDDs are plugged into the MoBo and jumper settings.

**EDIT:** You should have a good knowledge (or are willing to learn / Read:Spend time) on using Linux and the various procedures for booting. 

Also be aware that if you install linux to a drive, say, then windows to the same drive (different partition), it can OVER-WRITE the MBR(master boot record) thus undoing any other MBR that may have been setup in Linux.

NOTE: I have no experience with hackintoshes.

The way I would go about it: 

* Install windows to a drive.
* Possibly Hackintosh to a diff drive.
* install linux on a third drive.
* setup GRUB

","He's got it right GRUB is your friend. Install Ubuntu last and it will give you a boot loader you can use to select each OS.

This will be the official thread to show off and talk about your shiny new presents. 


If this is your first longboard the rest of this post is a guide for just that written by /u/USAF503

***

So you got a longboard as a present? First of all, welcome to the community. There's lots of helpful, friendly people in this sub so feel free to poke your head in to the Daily General Thread (stickied at the top each day), and make yourself known, ask questions, etc. Introduction out of the way, here is everything you need to know about how not to get yourself hurt or killed on your new board.




#**The Essentials**



**GEAR**

Your local skate shop is always going to be the best place to go for gear. Everything is shaped slightly differently, so you'll find that best fit in person.



**HELMET**

I'm sure more than once in your life someone has told you ""Always wear a helmet."" Well, they were right. [Longboarders, as a community (even outside of this sub), have acknowledged the danger of our sport, and take safety very seriously. There is near 0 tolerance for riding helmetless.](http://skatehousemedia.com/09/24/2013/comment-section-helmets-media-and-responsibility) It is the easiest way for you to get yourself seriously hurt, and there are far too many stories of death and brain damage floating around, and [even more stories of them saving people](https://youtu.be/b9yL5usLFgY). And don't be fooled, [there are plenty of chances to hit your head going slow](https://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/3xeppb/rlongboardings_daily_general_thread_dec_19_2015/cy49fo9). Riding helmetless scares nearby residents and lawmakers more than anything, and as such is the best way to get spots shut down. If you're just starting out, your best bet is going to be a half shell (as full faces are extremely expensive), just make sure it is CPSC/EN1078 dual certified or you wont be able to count on it for much. [These](http://triple8.com/product/dual-certified-brainsaver/?category_name=skate) are [good](http://www.predatorhelmets.com/fr7c/#), popular [choices](http://shop.s1helmets.com/s1-lifer-helmet-black-gloss/)



**[SLIDE GLOVES](http://longboardism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/BillyBonesSlideGloves.jpg)**

You're going to want to ride with these as much as possible. [They will save you a ton of roadrash if you fall](https://youtu.be/0icjnVgpf6g) and give you other options to stop or slow down like coleman slides. Just make sure to get a cheap pair to start cause you'll probably tear them quickly while you're learning.

Speaking of stopping...


#STOPPING

You shouldn't be going faster than you can safely stop. Period. If you're breaking this rule, you pose a threat to yourself and others. These should be the first 2 things you learn.



**[FOOTBRAKING](https://gfycat.com/KindlyDelectableCatbird)**

Footbraking is one of the 2 proper ways to stop. The simple rundown is that you take your rear foot off the board, and let it gently drag across the pavement slowing you down. [This tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LloIFi4Qb8) will give you some better instructions.


**[COLEMAN SLIDE](https://gfycat.com/GrizzledDecentBrant)**

This is the easiest, safest, most consistent slide you can do, which is why it is commonly used to shut down. [This tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t1hj6NL9U0) will get you started on that.


#The Open Road Bible

[This article by Max Dubler](http://skatehousemedia.com/11/05/2015/how-to-skate-open-roads-and-not-die-a-guide-to-best-practices) is the definitive, complete guide to skating open roads safely. An absolute must read. Seriously.



#Not Blowing It

[Bad behavior and poor community interaction blows spots. Leave the spot nicer than you left it. Smile, say hello, and be friendly with those around you. Play nice with traffic. Wear your gear. Leave and come back a few days later if someone complains. Respect security and police. Police other riders. These are the things you need to do to keep spots from getting blown and to keep them rideable.](http://skatehousemedia.com/07/18/2012/learning-curve-dont-blow-the-spot)




#The Extras



**Knee/Elbow pads**

Extra pads means less road rash, less bruises, less fractures, and longer life out of your pants. plain and simple.


**Spine protector**

You'll look like a ninja turtle, and it could very well save your life going fast. [Just ask Max Dubler](http://skatehousemedia.com/06/23/2014/learning-curve-max-dubler)


**Speed Wobbles**

99% of the time speed wobbles come from bad form. Keeping the majority of your weight over your front foot, staying calm, and having confidence gained through experience and the knowledge that you are able to stop safely will prevent the dreaded wobbles from happening as well as help recover from them when they do happen. Tightening your trucks helps very little, and causes a whole host of other problems.


That's everything you need to know to safely enjoy your new longboard. Welcome to the community. Go out and meet some people and remember to support local.

cqohgdz,"Today is day 90 of what I'm calling harder mode (hard mode with zero wet dreams, while married). You can read the bullets for the advice, and the following if you want some back story.

I'm 27 years old, been married for 6 years, have struggled with PMO since middle school.  I wasted a large portion of my teenage/high school years jerking off in solitude, trying to fill the holes in my heart with porn.  It didn't work, and I was always empty. Midway through college I formed a support group with some friends and had some success with NoFap (back in 2008, before NoFap was a thing).  I don't remember my longest streak, but it was in the range of 3-4 months.  I ended up meeting my wife during that streak, fell in love, got involved sexually, and ended up breaking my streak in part due to the chaser effect (which I wasn't aware of or prepared for back then).  

I won't go into all of my marital problems, as that isn't the point of this post or forum, but I will give some context.  Sex has been a contentious issue between my wife and I for several years now.  There is plenty of blame to go around between us (me turning to PMO, her letting stress and other things get in the way, her having rather extreme anxiety when we try to have sex, mostly because I felt like I needed sex and she wanted to be a good wife so she'd put out even when she wasn't in to it, which caused a lot of emotional duress). [This article was helpful in understanding the problem and my role in causing it](http://www.marriagebuilders.com/graphic/mbi5047_qa.html) 

Long story short, I've struggled with PMO throughout our whole marriage.  I haven't been into anything hardcore since high school/early college, but would PMO to ""softcore"" at least once a week (sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes just MO, more often as the frequency of sex dwindled then stopped).  Regardless, I always felt like shit about it, and always felt like I was causing all of the issues in the bedroom because I couldn't kick the PMO, no matter how hard I tried or how many times I resolved to be done with it. 

Around the end of December 2014, I was trying to research sexual anxiety when I came across www.reuniting.info, and the concept of karezza. (www.yourbrainonporn.com is a favorite site for reference around here. www.reuniting.info is by Gary's wife, which would imply that Gary practices karezza. Just throwing that bit of info out there, in case the following sounds entirely crack-pot-ish.) According to the site ""Karezza is a gentle, affectionate form of intercourse in which orgasm is not the goal, and ideally does not occur in either partner while making love."" There are also a lot of reports of it being helpful for recovering porn addicts (with PE and DE too). I was confused, but intrigued, so I read more.  I read about the side effects of orgasm, the dopamine roller coaster it causes, and the idea that the ""I'm done"" feeling after orgasm is just the start of a longer process that causes me to feel like I need sex or I'm going to die. Reading about the dopamine roller coaster caused by orgasm was like reading a synopsis of the last 15 years of my life.  Orgasm puts me on a path that never leads to true fulfillment, so I decided to opt out.

I stumbled onto www.yourbrainonporn.com via www.reuniting.info, and joined this sub shortly there after.  After learning about the orgasm roller coaster after 15 years of struggling, I feel like I've finally found some freedom.  I had a 21 day streak, 1 day of relapse, followed by this current 90 day streak since reading about karezza. As I mentioned, my wife and I are still working out our shit, so I haven't actually been able to test the karezza claims of mindblowing orgasmless sex with her, but regardless, learning to live a life where frequency of orgasm (or sexual fulfillment) has less of a bearing on overall happiness has been incredibly helpful to me.  

While 90 days is a neat milestone, it is just the beginning of a new lifestyle of freedom, where going back to old ways isn't an option.   

Now on to the advice portion...

My keys to success:

* **Understand the beast within.** Learning about the effects that orgasm has on me and my well being has been the #1 most important thing for me.  I've wanted to change for years, but it wasn't until I got a grasp on the never-ending tailspin that orgasm triggers that I found some freedom.  [Read this article, it was immensely helpful](http://www.reuniting.info/orgasms_hidden_cycle)

* **Embrace the suck.** Commit to withdrawal sucking.  Embrace it.  Learn to let the discomfort make you stronger. A part of the orgasm cycle is a 2 week period of wild mood swings as your dopamine levels even out.  Those 2 weeks are the hardest for me.  I feel depressed, completely unmotivated, angry, and all around miserably.  Around day 7, I feel like my genitals are going to explode from the pressure. But knowing the cycle lasts about 2 weeks, and that it will end, makes it much more bearable.

* **Resolve to never feel like shit again.**  When I PMO, I feel like absolute shit, like I'm living with a permanent hangover.  I feel like a guilt-ridden, depressed, foggy brained zombie with an appetite for more and more sex in any form (which unfortunately came mostly from my hand).  It made me say, think, and do things that I'm not proud of.  It did nothing but suck away my soul.  I never want to be that person again, and I never want to feel as shitty as I do when I PMO.  I've said this in other threads, but even the most mediocre day while streaking is 100x better than how I feel when PMOing.  This is probably my biggest motivator, in conjunction with knowing about the 2 week shit storm that follows PMO.  Why would I trade 30 minutes of looking at smut and a 30 second orgasm for 2 weeks (minimum, if I don't relapse) of feeling like complete shit?

* **Starve the sumo**  I read a book during college called ""Every Young Man's Battle"".  It is about PMO, etc.  I don't remember much about it (other than it was a sort of heavy-handed Christian book, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it), but one analogy still sticks with me.  They talk about your sexual desires being a sumo wrestler.  If you feed your desires, the wrestler gets bigger and harder to beat, but if you starve him, it is much easier to deal with when temptation comes knocking.  Don't feed your desire; don't oogle at girls on the street, don't click around looking for sexy pics, don't let your guard down. (Constant vigilance!)[http://imgur.com/gallery/xvKIrqg].

* **Remember** that it is going to suck.  I know I've said this, but it is incredibly important.  This is not easy.  We didn't get addicted to PMO over night, so we're not going to kick it over night either.  Every time you are tempted, embrace the suck, learn to channel it to make you stronger.

* **Ice cold showers**  I must admit that I'm not the best about taking entire showers in cold water.  I usually start off warm to luke warm for the hygiene parts, then switch to cold during the rinsing, then finish off by turn it to *100%-Michigan-ground-water-in-the-dead-of-winter* cold and spraying down my balls with that.  This last part sucks the first few times you do it, but it helps immensely with the pressure and blue-ball feeling.  It might also be a big reason that I haven't had any wet dreams yet, though that's just a guess (another reason may be that I constantly wake myself up just seconds before the wet portion of the wet dream...).

TL;DR, There is no success without first becoming a student (ie, read it chump...)","Really good post man. I'm 31 yo, married for a bit longer, suffer from any types of shit all these years. You kinda summarize my life here. ",,,

I think that guys with Rizzle Kicks' accent come across as fake, so I am incredibly tempted to treat them as if they don't have any feelings.

d0rovo8,"I'm not going to lie to you, it is getting harder and harder to break into the workforce and to even do so requires double the qualifications that previous generations needed BUT it's not impossible. 

Your in your first year, so focus on your first year. I made the mistake of trying to be an adult too fast and ended up burning out by the middle of semester 2. Instead of looking for jobs, join your uni societies and really make sure your grades are up there. Don't beat yourself up too much for not having a job right now. Like you've said, most internships require you to have finished first year, and that's for a good reason. Give em a transcript that wows them!

If it's any consolation, your peers are in the same boat. Statistically, people under 30 will have to wait 5 years from graduation before they even break out into an entry level job related to their course. This of course, can be helped by getting good grades and networking. Don't doubt the power of networking!

dmseh2o,"A relationship in my eyes serves to better the lives of both individuals taking part, helping each other grow and learn. 

When it starts to become one sided, and the love is superficial, holding one of the individual's back from growing and is making them feel restricted, then it's time to rethink and let go.

I do not know how to love myself outside of a relationship. My ex, which has been on and off, shows me love to convince me that what I think of myself isn't true. It has given me comfort and allows me to think more clearly.

I then look at her for answers, and see a flawed person just as I am. Life is beautiful, but everything is so utterly flawed. At this point, the relationship consumes and confines me and I can't think clearly. I then have to leave.

I want to be able to find my peace without depending on another person. What do I need to do in order to start getting closer to accomplishing this goal, or rather dream?

c9wtwi8,"First, I want to congratulate you. You are an incredibly strong woman, a warrior, in fact. You survived a childhood during which most would have perished-if not through suicide, then through drugs and drink and purposeful lack of awareness. 

You sound aware, and like you want something better for your son. That in and of itself is pretty fucking amazing. You are way, WAY stronger than you think you are. You need to acknowledge and recognize how fucking ballsy and amazing you are to have made it through thus far, in spite of such terrible, understandable pain. 

Now, the hard part. Relationships. You desperately want, like all of us do, to be loved for who you are, and love someone in return the same way. You're in  shitty relationship after shitty relationship (I mean, this guy who dumped you, what an insensitive ass, at the least, right?) and miserable and sad. 

And yet. What makes you think you have any training, any skills, in recognizing a healthy relationship-and maintaining one? Your only experience is with crazy people, far crazier than you, with no self awareness. You're expecting yourself, in a sense, to be a pro tennis player when you have never even picked up a racquet. Does that make sense? 

Good news: you can change. You need to teach your own self what is a good relationship-and what kind of people make for trustworthy, loving partners. I pretty much guarantee it's not the sort of guys you've been selecting. 

YOU deserve to be loved. And love in return. But you must teach yourself the skills necessary to have that kind of relationship, because no one did their fucking job when you were a child, and modeled for you what that looked like. 

This starts with loving yourself. Please get yourself to either an AA or co-dependents anonymous meeting, or a counselor. ASAP. You need some classes, essentially. A school. You wouldn't expect to play pro tennis without a coach and some fellow students around you. Don't expect yourself to learn this stuff alone. 

You are not alone. You are just walking around in the wilderness right now, cold and in pain, and alone, because you were never told or given the road map for where the good people are. 

You are a good person. If you don't feel like one, then become one, for that little boy of yours. Do so by freeing yourself of the terrible pain and suffering you were born into, courtesy of your parents. 

You have a long journey ahead, but I know you can do it. It will get easier, step by step. Love will help you along the way.

And ps. the drinking isn't going to help. Alcohol is an emotional depressant, and hurts you physically. Your son, quite frankly, needs you sober.  All the more reason for you to seek help. 

See you on the court. :)","This is probably the most helpful thing I have ever been told.  Especially paragraph 3, 5, 6 and 8.

64 had a number of interesting results for the first tournament of the season. 64bots veterans MBI, Ryu4090 and ShadowYoshi all went 0-2 with ShadowYoshi’s losses a noted shock to the best Yoshi in 64. MBI and Ryu’s losses were somewhat less surprising due to their use of lower tiered characters (DK and Puff respectively). 

A large amount of Pikachus and Kirbys entered the bracket, but only gcgr3 and DoodleNoodle26 were able to make top 8 with the characters. Also in top 8 were returning veterans bpcclo and Foxworthy88 placing 7th and 4th with their mains. UmbrionKnight achieved a high placement of 5th using the rarely seen Mario while previous 64bots host MaxSchersey entered his first serious 64 tournament, placing 3rd with Link. 

Newcomer BikeGameG tore through the bracket with Ness defeating multiple members of the future top 8 to make winners side of grand finals, but he was unable to overcome former top Fox main Tohmane, who won the tournament using another top tier, Captain Falcon.

In terms of character meta, 4 top tiers were chosen and 4 top tiers made up the top 4. Aside from this, the only real out-of-ordinary result was Sean_WRO’s Kirby defeating ShadowYoshi’s Yoshi in winners. UmbrionKnight’s Mario over gcgr3’s Pikachu can also be considered an upset, but with Mario being by far the least explored 64 CPU, we can’t really say for sure whether it’s an upset or just Mario finally getting the chance to play matches.

After Soda defeated Sean_WRO in the preshow, UmbrionKnight faced off against Killagod47. In this Mario vs DK matchup, Umbrion was dominant with Killa unable to get anything together. Following this, RacgiMan took on Sean and defeated him, utilizing some smart cloud play on Yoshi’s Island 64. Giffany~chan switched to a lower tier character to attempt to counterpick Zklosty, getting destroyed in the final game as a result. bp and DoodleNoodle26 defeated Ryu4090 and xOMBERX respectively, both taking early leads and holding on to them until the end. 

IceFreezer304 and ShadowYoshi took on Sean and KGPit, with ShadowYoshi being the sole survivor in both games despite Ice being the first player out. Racgi defeated Ryu, Ice won 2 close games against gcgr3, KGPit pulled off a three-stock in the process of beating PKMudkip, and ShadowYoshi had a close set with xOMBERX… until his switch to the high tier Dr. Mario. Giffany and Zklosty defeated the eternal MeleeBots doubles champions bp and gc to the music of John Cena in a game 3, last stock situation while PKMudkip clutched out 2 games against Killagod. 

Finally the main event was at hand as UmbrionKnight faced off against DoodleNoodle26. In the same matchup, Umbrion showed dominance against Killagod earlier but had notably lost to DoodleNoodle several times before in previous series. Winning game 1 solidly, Umbrion choked with an airdodge on Fourside and the momentum was all Doodle needed, taking the next two games without ever looking like he was behind.

In terms of the character meta, the upper tiers of the game took a back seat for this first week. 
 
Top tiers Peach, Dr. Mario and Mr. G&amp;W all made appearances in the event, but all showed weakness. Peach lost to Pikachu and had extremely close games with Donkey Kong. Dr. Mario performed well in doubles and against characters considered close to bottom tier, but notably dropped a game to Bowser. Mr. G&amp;W only appeared in doubles and was knocked out of the spotlight by a duo of Dr. Mario.
 
High tier Luigi performed terribly, losing to Yoshi, Ice Climbers and a doubles match against Fox/Zelda, unable to get any set wins. 
 
High-mid tiers Yoshi, Mario and Fox all performed decently, with Yoshi winning a game against Luigi, Mario going 3-3 in games vs DK, and Fox winning a doubles match and a (close) set against Pikachu.
 
Low-mid tiers DK, Pikachu and Bowser had some of the best performances of the tier list. DK was able to go even with the higher tier Mario and had two very close games vs Peach. Pikachu actually beat Peach and has close games with Fox. Bowser performed strongly in doubles and also took a game off top tier Dr. Mario.
 
Low tiers Zelda/Sheik, ICs and Jigglypuff had varying performances. Sheik was the last survivor in both games of the doubles set and the Zelda/Sheik pair showed some extreme combo potential against Jigglypuff. The ICs upset the high tier Luigi while Jigglypuff was unable to win any sets, but did have close games with Yoshi, DK and Zelda.
 
Bottom tiers Mewtwo and Pichu did not win anything, but Pichu brought the ICs to one very close game and also showed some combo potential against Bowser. Mewtwo was easily defeated in the only game played, vs Dr. Mario.

Edit: I just want to thank each of you for the immense amount of feedback this thread has received. I'm honestly surprised by the diversity this community has to offer. It's been an informative and entertaining experience for many of us as well as a chance for every individual here to share and get some thoughts off their chests.",I'm a 31 year old who after many years in technology is taking a break for a while.

Best thing is when I'll try to ask a question on where something is in the store (Lorac Pro 2, for example?), they will not answer and instead just try to shoo me away with ""The drugstore side is over there"" while blabbing with the other SA.

Right rank (Sgt), right initial, correct surname.   He served with  the Colours for 19 years 217 days and was discharged at York (from the West Yorkshire) on 16  July 1920. He had been an NCO for 17 years- a Colour Serjeant.

Firstly, Fatal bonds (if cast correctly) can have 2x damage increase, and 3x with refresher, since it stacks. Since it does 25% more damage per instance, and if cast on 4 heroes, it is .25 x 4 = 2 times the damage. Put down golem, cast heal, slow, and other aoe spells BECOME OP.

c6qvjv0,I'm with the boyfriend on this one. I love cumming on my wife (especially facials) and she loves it too. I used to have a GF that didn't like it and it sort of irked me a bit that there was a part of me that she hated or dispised.

c5cqhlc,"Haha. I tap my feet a LOT. But thats more restless leg syndrome I think. Although my calves are also HUGE, A fact that has been pointed out to me more than once.

Yes if multiple people in your family shake, then you most likely have essential tremor. My mum has the tremor, and her father has the tremor. Though its best to have it it checked by a neurologist. It is however, incurable.

On a side note, Just curious. Do you have any mental health issues if you don't mind me asking? Most likely depression and/or anxiety?","Yeah I've been suffering from depression last 3 or 4 years I suppose, it's hard to accurately pinpoint. I would say I have anxiety as well.

So, if anybody is interrested into making this happen (and getting a quality/free montage), you can prepare yourself to do some sicks plays in the incoming season AND, install [LoLSkinSpotlight Replay](http://www.skinspotlights.com/p/skinspotlights-replays.html) (recommended) so that I can record each of your moves and try to name them this way :  

**[Patch - Timestamp - Description -** *Skin* **]**

[Patch is written on the loading screen but here is the date for each, including the client for each patch](http://www.skinspotlights.com/p/playing-patch-52-replays-on-patch-53.html).  

Timestamp is the moment of the game when the move happen (~).  

Description, 1v3 Jungle, sick teamfight, ...  

I don't think I'll take older than S6 clips but if you got something insane feel free to send :)    
When you have a few good clips, upload them on either [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/) or [Mega](https://mega.co.nz/) in a Rar archive (using winrar) or clip by clip and write them here for now. *You can send your song aswell.*  

So, good luck on the Rift and let's make this happen !

ck5atfe,"For those watching for the first time, or for those who have followed all season and beyond, we would like to welcome you to the 43rd running of the International Suzuka 1000km, the oldest and most prestigious endurance race in Japan.

The longest race of the season at the most legendary circuit in Japan, Suzuka Circuit. Suzuka is best known for its timeless moments created as a stage in the Formula One World Championship. Today, 39 of Japan's best teams, split into two classes and representing many of the greatest automakers in the world, will drive a thousand grueling kilometers in the hopes of adding their name to a legendary list of winners.

Suzuka is Honda's home circuit. Since 1999, Honda cars have won this race seven times, and after a long and difficult start to the season, the new NSX-Concept GT is now a proven race winner in the hands of defending Suzuka champions, Naoki Yamamoto and Frederic Makowiecki, who start 7th. Keihin Real Racing NSX has only one win to their name, but team principal Katsutomo Kaneishi knows how to win here as a driver, and their Keihin NSX starts on the outside of row 1 with drivers Koudai Tsukakoshi and Toshihiro Kaneishi.

It has been a difficult season for the #36 Petronas RC-F, the primary car of Lexus Team TOM's. But Saturday, Kazuki Nakajima and James Rossiter took pole position for the second time in the last three races, and are looking to convert that into a third victory for TOM's. Meanwhile, their teammates Daisuke Ito and Andrea Caldarelli lead the GT500 championship, but are buried down in 13th on the grid - but they know it's a long race, and that they can certainly score points to bolster their title aspirations.

Their main rivals are Hironobu Yasuda and J.P. de Oliveira of Calsonic Team Impul, who are seeking their first championship in almost 20 years. They've won this race twice, in 2006 and 2008. They start 6th today, and a third victory for them will go a long way to help secure that elusive series championship. But it won't be easy as they face stiff competition from within the Nissan stable. Tsugio Matsuda and Ronnie Quintarelli start 3rd, which is where they sit in the championship, 10 points back of Ito and Caldarelli. They have the momentum to capture NISMO's first victory at this race since 1990. Meanwhile, Quintarelli's former teammate, Masataka Yanagida, is back at the team where the two drivers won both this race and the GT500 title just two years ago - MOLA International. Their S Road GT-R is fourth on the grid, and will be co-driven by Satoshi Motoyama, twice a Super GT winner here, but never in the 1000km race.

The GT300 championship is heating up as well - the two top teams (#11 Dixcel SLS, #4 Hatsune Miku BMW) are mired down in Row 9, giving the rest of the field a chance to catch up. Honda continues their home-track advantage by locking out the front row of the GT300 grid, with the ARTA CR-Z of Shinichi Takagi and Takashi Kobayashi on pole, and the 3-driver tandem of Nakayama, Nojiri, and returning three-time winner Ryo Michigami on the outside in the Mugen CR-Z. In fourth is three-time class winners R&amp;D Sport, with the same Subaru BRZ that won last year with drivers Kota Sasaki and Takuto Iguchi.

A thousand kilometers separates challenger from champion, it can solidify a legendary career, or create a legend overnight.

caey4hu,"I'm neither fluent in Japanese nor a linguist (EDIT: so don't listen to me, listen to /u/MentalSieve), but I do know that Japanese has fairly different masculine and feminine registers; in particular, certain more assertive particles and forms are almost exclusively used by men, while other forms are more feminine.

For example, Japanese has several first-person singular pronouns, and while some (like *watashi*) are gender-neutral, others are either masculine (like *ore*) or feminine (like *atashi*). A lot of it has to do with informality and assertiveness — male forms tend to be less formal and more assertive — so I'm not sure whether the words are actually gendered on a grammatical level or if they're just used like that due to societal gender roles.","From what I've experienced *Boku* is a more common way of saying I, if you're a guy, than Ore.

We've changed the structure of how our weekly days go, thanks to your feedback. We will have a daily post every day, but on several days of the week, we have a theme:

* Monday - Motivational Monday: Check in, set a new challenge for the week, get motivated for the week to come.
* Wednesday - Workout Wednesday: Workout tips and tricks to keep you active through the challenge
* Friday - Food Friday: Share your recipes, cooking successes and favorite meals
* Sunday - Success Sunday: Reflect on your week and get ready to weigh in tomorrow!!

This combines our challenge and weigh in days so that you only need to get into the spreadsheet once a week.

In the interim between the end of our current round and the beginning of our next round, you are welcome to participate and we will still post the theme days during that week :)

d6eulbt,"Hello PF,

My trusty beater has kicked the bucket. I was planning to buy something newer in about 6 months (after paying off some debt), but the time has come and I'm weighing my options.

* $31k annual gross/$57k combined household

* $3250/month take home after deductions (4% 403(b), insurance, etc.)

* $2200 monthly expenses

* $5400 CC debt

* ~$2000 in savings

* Currently using additional income to pay off debt (slated to pay off by March 2017, though purchasing a car will slow that down)

* Pre-qualified for financing through Capital One, estimated 3.21% financing for the car I'm looking at

* 2016 Hyundai Elantra GT, new, list price $16,500, hoping to pay $15,000-$15,500 (do you think I could go even lower?) 

* Estimated monthly payment of $275 if I get it at the price I am hoping

I have looked at used cars, but the interest rates are so high that the overall cost doesn't change much. I have a 60 mile daily round-trip commute, and I do a lot of driving, so I need something fuel efficient with low miles.

Car insurance quotes don't show a very big change in my monthly premium (about $15, I have a great driving record).

My old car gets about 20 mpg, new car 25city/34hwy, which should help reduce fuel costs quite a bit (I drive mostly highway)

I'd love to get the PF opinion. Fortunately, SO's family is lending me a spare car for a while until I get everything straightened out. 

Also, I could get together the 20% down, but I'm nervous about putting down literally all of my cash on a car.

This news has made me wonder how international relations were handled in Europe before the advent of the League of Nations. Additionally, how old is the idea that, strictly for example, the United States government should concern itself with secession in the Ukraine?

I understand that this may bring up an obnoxious amount of flaming and trolling. If this thread becomes too aggressive I am fine with the mods deleting it.","Hi I may be able to help here (currently studying my MA in International relations)

Prior to the League of Nations (which did fail in the end) there was the 'Concert of Europe' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe) during the 1815-1914 Period. It was very much about the maintenance of the 'Balance of Power' In Europe. The issue is that because of Imperialism (This being the high point of the practice, though this is open to debate) there was not that much other forums outside of bilateral negotiation and the US existed in a position of Isolation which it maintained after the league of nations was instituted (again, often held as a reason for the LoN's Failure). As far as I am aware, the US prior to this point did not have a huge interest in events outside of its sphere of influence in the Atlantic/Pacific regions where it held dominance.

Hobsbawm's age of empire or age of extremes would shed some light on this. their pretty available in most places in the UK at the very least and offer a great introduction into history in this period. another good introduction is the Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, which while realist in outlook is again a great introductory text. (in my opinion anyway)

Hope this helps

d8gh7pq,"I matched with this girl on Tinder about 3-4 weeks ago and we decided to hang out. Let's call her Jill.

So Jill comes over to my apartment, and brings her dog with her. I *love* dogs, but this was one of those situations where she didn't train it at all, and was constantly making excuses for her behavior. She jumped up on me and scratched me the whole time (Drawing blood). In addition to that, we just didn't really click. I was having to keep the conversation going the whole time. She leaves, and later that afternoon she messages me again telling me she wanted to kiss me and that she wanted to hang out again.

I hadn't had any sort of physical affection from anyone in months at this point, and it was starting to affect my self-esteem so of course I agreed for her to come back later.

Fast forward to when she comes over later. She shows up at my door without her dog this time, but high on 15 Klonopin (according to her). She was completely out of it the whole time. She would start kissing me, stop, and then ask me what just happened. When I would tell her that she kissed me, she was like ""was it good?"" We keep kissing for a little while but then she literally starts *passing out while we're kissing*. Like while our lips are actually touching. I tell her that it isn't working and ask her to head home so she doesn't fall asleep at the wheel on her way. (Since someone mentioned it, I should add that I made sure she did not drive while high, i offered to let her sleep on my couch, and made her some coffee when she wasn't interested in that.)

After all of this, I obviously didn't want to hang out again. 3 hours after she leaves she starts messaging me about how she misses me. This is the point where I tell her it isn't working and that we shouldn't pursue anything together. She said she wanted to be friends, but this is not a person I want to be friends with. I told her the most I'm comfortable with is a casual acquaintanceship.

I stopped responding when she kept asking why I didn't want to be friends and she left me alone.

**Until now.**

Jill again starts messaging me, asking for a fresh start and saying she wants to be friends.

I've never had anyone be so aggressive about wanting to be friends with me after something romantic not working out, and to be honest it scares me quite a bit. It's safe to say that I do not want to be her friend.

What should I do raptors? How do I get her to leave me alone and move on with her life?

TL;DR - Matched with a girl I didn't mesh with on tinder. She became aggressive about being my friend when it didn't work out and won't leave me alone. What do?","Just be honest, and cut her off. I think you need to flat out tell her that she needs to get her shit together and that you don't want to be involved. Saying that you can be acquaintances sounds reasonable to you and me but to her it's probably more like letting her think she still has a chance.",,,

daoc2lm,"First thing to check is: 
Is the Chemex clean? Make sure you clean it real well with detergent and hot water. 

One thing to keep in mind is to always take a grinder's recommended grind setting with a grain of salt. 

Since its all about brew time, a good ratio to check to see if the grind size is good is 1:15. So, on a larger scale that will look like 20gcoffee:300gwater (40:600,60:900,etc).

There are many preferred ratios, but this one is easy to test on because the numbers are easy. If you brew with a 20:300 recipe , all the water should drain out by 3:00min flat. If you brew with a 40:600 recipe, it should drain out by 6:00min flat. I have a Baratza Encore and I also have a Chemex. Try this recipe 40gcoffee:600gwater target time is 6:00min. Increase your bloom to 45sec-1:00min. After that, add the water in stages. 100g, wait 10 secs, 100g wait 10 secs, 100g wait sec, and so on. Do this all the way up to 600g and then let it drain. If it all drains by 6min, you'll know the grind size is good.

It's only a matter of time before I look out across the dining room to see half of any given kid's meal is all over the floor. 

If I was a father (a chill just went down my spine), I would be horrified at my kids wasting food like that. These parents paid for their kids to eat it, they barely managed half of it, and I can only imagine the kids will be complaining they are hungry an hour later. Sounds like a recipe for a bad time.

To make matters worse, the bulk of these parents don't even make the barest pretense of feeling bad about it or trying to stop their kids from eating like savages or having a food fight. Or both. There's one father in particular who always tries to strike up a conversation with me, and while he seems like a nice enough guy, it's all tainted by the fact that his boys are two of the messiest eaters in our pool of regulars. 

He *must* know that his kids are making my life harder, that I die a little inside every time I see him walk in because the kids aren't far behind, that I have to force a smile every time I walk up to his table with a broom and dust pan as he's leaving and he tells me to have a nice day. Motherfucker, I would have a nice day if you could teach your children how to function in society. These aren't special needs kids. They're not so young they have trouble sitting up or articulating that they are having trouble swallowing. I'd peg them around six and eight. I don't expect kids at that age to be model citizens, but why are you letting them out of the house when they act like savages and why, for the love of God, do you give them a pass?

On the lighter side, there is one couple who generally do a pretty good job of wrangling their incredibly messy kids. This second pair of boys has, in the past, started throwing chips at each other when the father got up to go to the bathroom. Cool dad was absolutely mortified and gave the two a stern (but not shouty or over-the-top) talking to right there in public and made them apologize to me before they left. He even offered to sweep up the mess they had left because he felt guilty about it all.

Good afternoon. As of today, I am officially a former ""digital media specialist"" (a nice way to say ""paid Internet troll"") previously employed by Hillary Clinton's campaign (through a PR firm). I'm posting here today as a confession of sorts because I can no longer continue to participate in something that has become morally-indigestible for me. (This is a one-time throwaway account, but I'll stick around for this thread.)

First, my background. I am [redacted] ... and first became involved in politics during the 2008 presidential race. I worked as a volunteer for Hillary during the Democratic primary and then for the Democratic Party in the general election. I was not heavily involved in the 2012 election cycle (employment issues - volunteering doesn't pay the rent), and I wasn't really planning on getting involved in this cycle until I was contacted by a friend from college around six months ago about working on Hillary's campaign.

I was skeptical at first (especially after my experience as an unpaid volunteer in 2008), but I eventually came around. The work time and payment was flexible, and I figured that I could bring in a little extra money writing about things I supported anyways. After some consideration, I emailed my resume to the campaign manager he had named, and within a week, I was in play. I don't want to get bogged down on this subject, but I was involved with PPP (pay per post) on forums and in the comments section of (mostly-liberal) news and blog sites. Spending my time on weekends and evenings, I brought in roughly an extra $100 or so a week, which was a nice cushion for me.

At first, the work was fun and mostly unsupervised. I posted mostly positive things about Hillary and didn't engage in much negativity. Around the middle of July, however, I received notification that the team would be focusing not on pro-Hillary forum management, but on ""mitigation"" (the term our team leader used) for a Vermont senator named Bernie Sanders. I'd been out of college for several years and hadn't heard much about Sanders, and so I decided to do some research to get a feel for him. 

To be honest, I was skeptical of what Sanders was saying at the beginning, and didn't have much of a problem pointing out the reasons why I believed that Hillary was the better candidate. Over a period of two months, I gradually started to find Bernie appealing, even if I still disagreed with him on some issues. By September, I found myself as a closet Bernie supporter, though I still believed that Hillary was the only electable Democratic candidate. 

The real problem for me started around the end of September and the beginning of October, when there was a change of direction from the team leader again. Apparently, the higher-ups in the firm caught wind of an impending spending splurge by the Clinton campaign that month and wanted to put up an impressive display. We received very specific instructions about how and what to post, and I was aghast at what I saw. It was a complete change in tone and approach, and it was extremely nasty in character. We changed from advocates to hatchet men, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth.

Just to give you an idea, here are some of the guidelines for our posting in October:

1) Sexism. This was the biggest one we were supposed to push. We had to smear Bernie as misogynistic and out-of-touch with modern sensibilities. He was to be characterized as ""an old white male relic that believed women enjoyed being gang raped"". Anyone who tried to object to this characterization would be repeatedly slammed as sexist until they went away or people lost interest.

2) Racism. We were instructed to hammer home how Bernie supporters were all privileged white students that had no idea how the world worked. We had to tout Hillary's great record with ""the blacks"" (yes, that's the actual way it was phrased), and generally use racial identity politics to attack Sanders and bolster Hillary as the only unifying figure.

3) Electability. All of those posts about how Sanders can never win and Hillary is inevitable? Some of those were us, done deliberately in an attempt to demoralize Bernie supporters and convince them to stop campaigning for him. The problem is that this was an outright fabrication and not an accurate assessment of the current political situation. But the truth didn't matter - we were trying to create a new truth, not to spread the existing truth.

4) Dirty tactics. This is where things got really bad. We were instructed to create narratives of Clinton supporters as being victimized by Sanders supporters, even if they were entirely fabricated. There were different instructions about how to do it, but something like this (http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/31/1443064/-Dis-heartened-Hillary-Supporter) is a perfect example. These kind of posts are manufactured to divide and demoralize Sanders supporters, and are entirely artificial in nature. (The same thing happened in 2008, but it wasn't as noticeable before social media and public attention focused on popular forums like Reddit).

5) Opponent outreach. There are several forums and imageboards where Sanders is not very popular (I think you can imagine which ones those are.) We were instructed to make pro-Sanders troll posts to rile up the user base and then try to goad them into raiding or attacking places like this subreddit. This was probably the only area where we only had mixed success, since that particular subset of the population were more difficult to manipulate than we originally thought.

In any case, the final nail in the coffin for me happened last night. I was on an imageboard trying to rile up the Trump-supporting natives with inflammatory Bernie posting, and the sum of responses I received basically argued that at least Bernie was genuine in his belief, even if they disagreed with his positions, which made him infinitely better than the 100% amoral and power-hungry Hillary.

I had one of those ""what are you doing with your life"" moments. When even the scum of 4chan think that your candidate is too scummy for their tastes, you need to take a good hard look at your life. Then this morning I read that the National Association of Broadcasters were bankrolling both Clinton and Rubio, and that broke the camel's back. I emailed my resignation this morning. 

I'm going to go all in for Bernie now, because I truly believe that the Democratic Party has lost its way, and that redemption can only come by standing for something right and not by compromising for false promises and fake ideals. I want to apologize to everyone here for my part in this nasty affair, and I hope you will be more aware of attempts to sway you away from supporting the only candidate that can bring us what we need.

c4t8r9n,"Ok, i've been working on this problem for a few hours and I can't figure out what i'm doing wrong for the life of me. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

(x + h)^-3 - x^-3 / h


without going into every detail I get:

x^3 - (x + h)^3 / x^3 (x+h)^3 / h

this gives me:

x^3 - x^3 - h^3 / x^3 (x + h)^3 / h


Then I multiply:

-h^3 / x^3 (x+h)^3  * 1 / h

The final answer I get is:

h^2 / x^3 (x+h)^3

It's wrong and I have no idea what i'm doing wrong. I tried a few different ideas I had and i'm still wrong, it's been driving me crazy. Any help at all would be appreciated. Thanks. Also, what would be best for me to review to get a better understanding of what i'm doing wrong?

Edit: Sorry for the shitty formatting, that's the best I could get it.
","It appears your problem is when you multiply (x+h)^3.  (x+h)^3 does not equal x^3 + h^3.  Remember your basic exponent rules:  If you have something to the 3rd power, that means you have three of them multiplied together.  In other words, (x+h)^3 = (x+h)(x+h)(x+h).  And, if you remember Pascal's triangle, you won't have go through all the work to multiply it out (otherwise you will).
