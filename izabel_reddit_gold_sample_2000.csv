These are very expensive funds. The Franklin fund has a 4.25 load (they only invest 95.75% of the money you give them) and an .63 expense ration.  

I'd sell your stock and move on to Vanguard.  Start with a Target date fund while you figure out mutual funds.  Call up Vanguard to initiate the move.

BTW: The stock in the account should have a tax basis of it's value on the date of death of the previous owner (you say both inherited and gift, so I'm not sure how you got this.). The only capital gain/loss on the sale would be compared to the value on that date. The executor of the estate can tell you.

I am an ugly woman. Objectively, I really am. Please don't argue with me on this one, Reddit. I am not overweight, actually in better shape than most women my age, I dress well, I am great with makeup.

But last weekend the world just had to remind me that despite all this, people will go out of their way to kick me.

I don't often go clubbing, but Saturday night was a special occasion. A friend was celebrating her 21st, and it was also the weekend after a long week of brutal exams. It felt like a good time to blow off some steam. Because I don't often go clubbing, I really tried this night to look nice. There was an outfit that I had bought a long time ago, but that I'd never worn because it was a little sexier than what I usually wear. A close friend had picked it out for me when we were shopping, and, in that ""you go girl"" kind of way had urged me to buy it. I did my makeup painstakingly, straightened my hair which always takes forever because my hair is huge, put on that too-sexy-for-me outfit. 

And when I looked in the mirror I was even surprised at myself. ""Wow, is that me? I actually look...nice!""

I showed my friends. They all said I looked great. And they MEANT it too. Like, genuine happy encouragement. I could tell they were sincere and it made me feel so good, like for once I wasn't just masquerading as an attractive girl with fancy makeup and clothes, but that I WAS the attractive girl. I hadn't felt so attractive in ages, Reddit.

When we got to the club, we got a nasty surprise. We had been told that tonight there was no cover charge for girls, and so none of us had brought much cash on our person. Well, our info was wrong. They did indeed ask for a cover. Only one of us 6 girls had cash, and she only had enough to cover two people. When we got to the door and found this out, a group of guys behind us volunteered to help us out. They each forked over a couple of bucks to cover my friends, but not one of them offered to cover me. One by one my friends were let in and they waited on the other side of the door until everyone got through. There was an ATM machine nearby and at this point I was wishing I could just slip away and get the cash from there, but I was holding up the line, my friends weren't about to enter without me, and it was rather chilly and no one waiting in line was getting any happier. The guys were doing everything to avoid eye contact with me. They were looking at the ground, the street, pretending to look through their wallets for cash to cover one more girl. It was so painfully obvious that I felt like just going home. Luckily, my friend with the extra cash covered me so I was allowed in.

Well, once we were inside I thought I could just forget about that incident. I had dressed up and come out, to have a good time and relax.  So for a while I danced with my friends. It wasn't long before other guys started dancing with us. We kind of paired off slowly, there was a guy whose two buddies had started dancing with other girls and he was left alone. At that point I too had lost track of my friends and was alone. He started dancing with me, but the whole time he seemed really distracted. Not once did he really look at my face, he was kinda looking around the club the whole time, like he was browsing the scene for another, more attractive girl he could bounce to. In less than 10 minutes, he had seen one. He peaced out without a word, and I saw him dancing a few minutes later with a very attractive brunette. The way he acted with her was just SO different than when he had danced with me. He was face to face with her, smiling, dancing enthusiastically.

That made my stomach drop. I went to the bar, found one of my friends who was sitting there with a guy. She introduced us, he bought everyone drinks. After a while I felt like a bit of a third wheel so I went back to the dance floor.

Eventually my group of girls regathered together. Everyone had a guy, except for one of them who had a bf at home. So I danced with her, with our friends and their guys near us. 

There was a photographer going around the club, taking pictures of the people there. I assume it was for some promo for their website or something. He got to our group, and literally circled us several times, taking several pics from different angles. I was kind of psyched about this, so I did my best to look like I was having a good time, made sure he could snap me at my best. But after a while I realized he wasn't circling us to get our best angles. He was trying to get a frame without ME. If I moved closer to the center of the group, for instance, he would tilt his camera a little the other way. I couldn't believe it until finally, he actually came up to me and asked me to get out of the shot.

I felt so ugly right then. For all the effort I had put into looking and feeling good that night, it seemed like it just didn't matter. So the night ends with me leaving the club. My friend with the bf at home who was dancing with me left with me so I wouldn't be alone. The rest of my girl friends didn't notice what had happened with the photographer, so when they asked me where I was going I just told them I was tired and wanted to go home. And since I wasn't leaving alone, they let me.

So yeah, that's my story from the weekend.

Please be kinder to ugly people, Reddit. Maybe one of the people I met that night will read this post and recognize themselves. I hope so, if only so they can know how behavior they're barely conscious of can affect someone else.

EDIT: I have always been a lurker on Reddit so I'm not sure if I can find out who gave me gold. But thank you, stranger! I will enjoy this gold while it lasts. :)

EDIT2: A number of people have asked for a picture of me to judge for themselves if I really am as unattractive as this post suggests. I know you all mean well but my looks are a bit of a sore point right now so I will not be sharing any photos on Reddit. I was able to post this story because of my relative anonymity here on a massive internet forum under a throwaway account. I do not want to give up this anonymity.

I say that's not the one I wanted and that I didn't want to drink it right now but that I would buy it anyways since it was already opened for me.  The cashier rolls her eyes and disappears again.

cs1xf2n,"There are a lot of gradients in music. Think of the following on a sliding scale.

Volume

Pitch

Vibrato (quickly changing pitch back and forth between two adjacent notes)

For example when the music says to play loud, your loud is different than my loud. Thats something that can be very noticable as skilled musicians have good control of volume at any given moment they are playing. While i may play partd of a melody quietly, another may play it a little louder.

Most musicians that are skilled, will work extensively in developing a vibrato. Now you can start right at the beginning of the note, or you can have a straight tone for .02 seconds before adding vibrato. Not only that but each musicians change in pitches (how far up and down they move when they vibrato) also vary.

None of this is written in the sheet Music usually. So when you listen to a solo performance look at how each individual note weaves, whether gradually into the next, or choppy, where the musician quiets down or gets louder, and so forth.","Also tempo/rhythm. Note lengths are never going to be robotically precise and a skilled musician can play with note lengths without actually changing the rhythm of the piece.

dffnb82,"When you say you want to study electrical engineering and organic chemistry, do you mean you want to double major? Or get one degree and take classes in the other field?

I don't think that UMD offers an organic chemistry major. There are just biochemistry, chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science.

Trying to double major electrical engineering and chem would be difficult. Chem has labs which are a huge schedule sink, and both majors are tough. You could certainly come in and get into electrical engineering and minor in Chem, or just take chem classes up through Orgo I and II as electives for the hell of it. As long as you plan out your major classes and gen eds, any open room in your schedule is totally free to pursue whatever learning you want. It would be tougher, though not impossible, to come in as Chem and take EE classes, since engineering classes are restricted to engineers and you would need to contact the engineering school to get in.

In terms of WPI versus UMD, WPI is a far smaller school, with maybe a sixth or less of the undergrads that UMD has. If you enjoy the small school feel and vibe, WPI is a fine choice. But at UMD you get both. Lots of classes are taught in lecture halls, but they all have small discussion sections taught by TAs which gives you more individualized attention and classmate interaction. A lot of upper levels are taught in smaller class sizes too.

Also, at WPI, class terms are seven weeks, meaning they go *fast*. It's grueling. At UMD, they go half that speed. Not to mention Worcester is kind of the middle of nowhere and UMD has the Metro for access to Washington, D.C..

Lastly, UMD being a big school means that you get a TON of internship opportunities and resources. Everywhere you look, there are programs and research opportunities that you can put on your resume. It's fantastic.

Ultimately, the decision comes down to what you want to get out of your school. Do you want a small, study focused, intense academic environment? Or a bigger, traditional campus with more amenities and loads of curated opportunities?","Wouldn't the faster pace at WPI mean I learn more.

d649182,"Hello fellow Redditors! (TL;DR - Below)

Been a long time lurker, I've really learnt a lot from you guys. Now I am looking for some thoughts and your experiences that could push me to the right direction - I'll try to keep this on point and short, but I'm quite bad at that :D

A brief background to my pre ADD diagnosis - I feel its relevant to the story, so here goes, long story short. 
You can skip to the last 4 paragraphs to get right to my ADHD diagnosis etc.

Had a really messed up childhood, my biological mother has had severe schizophrenia since I can remember (basically super paranoid and lives in her own world). Moved to live with my dad when I was six - he got married with another woman (lived as a housewife) at that time and got my step-brother a year later. Step-mother turns out to be the most fuc*ed up person I've ever met - started abusing me right when I moved in - physical and mental abuse almost daily, and not just pulling your ear/hair, but beating me and my step brother with objects etc. Super manipulative, two-faced, lying, humiliating etc. 

My dad is the absolute opposite of my step-mom, but was busy running his business and travelling almost weekly, whenever he was home she'd 'act normal'. At the time I was scared and didn't know what to do, so never spoke to my dad. Fast forward to when I'm 16 my dad finds out about abuse -&gt; divorce -&gt; big mess -&gt; things start settling down and FINALLY I get to try and start living a normal teenage life.

I was never offered/seeked any therapy etc after all that crap came to light. I thought I was a fairly normal and from the outside to all my friends I seemed like a really normal kid.

Started dating my first GF at 18 - she suggested that I go to therapy (and learnt that apparently people go to psychotherapy for even more trivial things). Still I thought that I don't 'need' that stuff. But she planted a seed. 

I managed to get through high-school, but just barely. I failed courses because I was late too often. And I often left assignments undone - whereas they were easy. At 22 got to Uni to study International Business, super motivated, everything is interesting (almost), I have a good drive at school, I thrive in group assignments, I am often the most active person during lectures, build myself a 'GTD' system, try to be super organised, use my os x calendar / wunderlist for everything. BUT STILL, even when I receive an assignment and I'm like shit, this my thing, and I'm gonna get a 100/100 score on this, but I barely get half of it done and never return the damn assignment, I might help my friends get their assignments done but no, not my own. The most annoying thing is when you know friends, who are not as smart/good or even passionate in something as you are, are successfully getting through everything and moving forward and you are just standing still not moving anywhere.

Fours years of Uni doing my bachelors, had to retake a bunch of courses and the only thing thats left is my thesis. And that shit is never getting done, with the way things are with ADD.

So two years ago, when I was 26 I realise I'm underperforming really bad and not keeping up with my peers - and this is seriously effecting my life/career/family/friendships. At first I thought this must have something to do with my messed up childhood, that something must have left an effect on me. Eventually I manage to get myself to a good psychotherapist, after approx. 10hrs of sessions both of us go through different options and come to the conclusion that I might have ADD. She suggests that I take a test to check, so we do the adults WAIS-IV test and it strongly indicated that I have ADD (Verbal and perceptual abilities ranked in the high average -- whereas processing-speed and working-memory were weak.)

I go to see the psychiatrist who confirms ADD and puts me on meds.
First we try Wellbutrin/Voxra --&gt; 150mg --&gt; 300mg for 3months / no effect, only lost interest in nicotine/snus.
Then we try Concerta, titrate from 18mg to 54mg and I even went on to try 72mg / no effects at all.

After concerta I haven't seen my psychiatrist, I have been off meds for the last 4 months.
NOW, I'm just too confused about whats going on and what to do - early on I wasn't convinced that I have ADD, but after research and my girlfriends experiences of me it makes sense and I'm quite confident I have ADD. 
I maintain a normal semi-healthy diet, I run ca. 30km/week and do bodyweight workouts 2x/week.

Regarding medication, do you have any suggestions? Should I try Vyvanse/Elvanse or can other methylphenidate based meds work when Concerta did not? I'm still in the same frustrating point where I can't get a grip of my daily life and pursue stuff that I'm passionate about, just turned 28 and I really have a lot to catch up on to.

Ah, there it is. Quite a read, and probably quite messy. I've planned on posting here for ages but never got to it.

Thanks.

TL;DR
Messed up childhood, mother schizophrenic / stepmother abusive&amp;manipulative
//At 16 get rid of stepmother - start living normal life
//Generally I'd say I'm smarter than average / but high-school and Uni. is constant surviving on the edge.
+ I'm f**king late to absolutely everywhere/not getting stuff done, everybody close to me lose their shit for that.
//Getting older (25) realise that I'm not keeping up with my peers and underperforming everywhere.
//First thought -&gt; messed up childhood has still some effect on me -&gt; first time consider psychotherapy
//After a year of wondering 'to go or not' - I get myself to a psychotherapist
//10hrs of sessions -&gt; me and my therapist come to conclusion I might have ADD
//WAIS-IV test indicates following --&gt; processing speed and working memory both weak --&gt; I HAVE ADD
//MEDICATION: Start with 3months 300mg Wellbutrin/Voxra, no effect -&gt; 3months Concerta, titrate 18-&gt;36-&gt;54 (try //72 on my own) and no effect.
Now just confused as what to do, other methylphenidate meds or vyvanse/elvanse or other ideas?","Try the dexamphetamine family of meds. Ritalin (methylphenidate) was a fail for me, however dex worked. The literature suggests that for the majority of ADHD sufferers (~80%?), either one or both families of commonly prescribed amphetamine meds  (methylphenidate or dexamphetamine) will work. 

If neither work, there are still other meds you can try. ",,,

dftxre0,"&gt;I'd argue that critical thinking doesn't reach a cap just because the worldview of godlessness has been achieved.

I think the argument would be the reverse, that you weren't quite at a reasonable level of critical thinking, not that you had maxed out yet. Either way, I don't wholly agree with a hypothetical sentiment of not having critical thinking capacity if you're religious. 

&gt;There is literally no meaning without purpose

This is something that a lot of people get stuck on, myself included. There's a very important question that people need to ask themselves: Let's say there's no inherent purpose to life. So what?

Obviously it's way easier said than done, to dismiss needing a specific purpose in life. I still have issue with it, and it's why I wish I was a believer. It would handle that for me. Atheism can be a hard road for a believer because it's a sort of harsh reality - that we have no purpose, no reason to exist beyond the same simple purposes other animals and even plants do. That the universe might be a cold and uncaring expanse that happens to be beautiful in many ways, and produce worlds of all kinds that may or may not be inhabited by other beings who go through the same shit we do.

Aside from not wanting to be a blank slate of purpose, I don't see the reason to believe that we were made with one. Or that we were ""made"" at all.

&gt;But my life has meaning again and it feels so good to not be staring into the abyss.

I hear ya there. That is a great feeling. 
","&gt; Atheism can be a hard road for a believer because it's a sort of harsh reality - that we have no purpose.

It would be interesting to see your line of reasoning for how you can rationalize that statement as axiomatic.

cvtdnna,"Hi, questioning!

I'm feeling a little strange and have some questions and don't know where else to turn, quite frankly.  I've been in straight relationships my entire life, but I have drunkenly made out with a couple of guys before (incidents which I always wrote off as drunken experimenting).  Lately I've been experiencing a lack of sex drive and occasional sexual dysfunction with my girlfriend, issues which have arisen in prior relationships as well, and yesterday I decided, on a whim, to check out some gay porn, to see if that did anything for me.  I'd be lying if I said that I didn't find it very arousing, though I'm not sure if I find it more or less arousing than straight porn, and even if I do, I'm left wondering whether or not it's because its gay porn or because it's something new.  Either way, it's put me in a position where I'm beginning to question my sexuality.

As I think about things, I keep coming back to the fact that I've never really felt an attraction to men in a romantic sense, though I have been in love with women before.  And honestly, I've never watched gay porn or anything like that previously, but I find it arousing now, and I just don't know how to feel about it.  I keep wondering if maybe I've repressed my feelings about my own sexuality, and that's why I've never come to this realization before, and I wonder what the potential implications are.  I also don't know where to proceed from here- I feel a little ashamed, confused, and anxious, and I don't know what to do right now.  How do I move forward?

SO much more imagination, better toys, and the HOBBIES!

dcywrxl,"**Edited 29 Jan 2017:**For those who are curious to know how it went. It was hmm... uneventful!. We all had a good time though.  I don't think anyone from Reddit showed up (at lease none that revealed themselves).  I did meet a table full of Thai guys. They were a bit younger and little drunk. They ended talking to me more than to the girls. So I don't know! 


Anyway, for those that tend to want to over analyze this situation, it really was just a casual get-together.  I invited everyone (my mistake for only emphasizing farangs, but that was because it was the subject of my original conversation with my girlfriend as stated in my post).  Not meant to exclude anyone.  

And I can't tell you how and what and why the girls are still single. They seem normal to me.  They are so many reasons. You can't really make assumptions about someone you haven't met, can you? (or maybe we can since we're on Reddit!).  If you are interested, just try to join me next time and get to know them yourself!!  


I'll post some pics if I get an Ok from the girls..

https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/5qc20e/challenged_by_my_thai_girlfriend_to_find_farang/

**tl;dr** If you want to meet 3 nice and well educated Thai women (in their mid 30s), please come to Mikkeller Bangkok (on 26 Ekkamai Soi 10 Yeak 2.)  tonight (Friday 27 Jan) any time after 7:30PM.




Guys, Please help!!!  I have been tasked with a difficult challenge. My Thai girlfriend has 3 really good friends who are nice looking, intelligent and well educated (they all went to study in England). They are all in their mid 30s, come from good families and have good jobs.  They all have great  personality, but due to their “good profiles”, it has been difficult for them to really date Thai guys.  I guess Thai guys usually find smart and successful women intimidating.

Yesterday I said to my girlfriend that I don’t understand why her friends don’t have any boyfriends. If Thai guys can’t handle them, there are plenty of farang guys that would love to get to know them. “Well, if you think it’s so easy, find farang guys for my girlfriends to meet then!”, she said.

So here I am. 

I’m actually a Thai-American (a bit more Thai than American) guy in my 40’s.  Most of farang colleagues and friends are married or have girlfriends. And this week a few potential suitable farangs that I know are unavailable. So I thought of this “social experiment” and figured Reddit could help! 

Anyway, if you are free Friday night (27 Jan) and would like to meet cute, nice, smart and fun Thai women, please come to Mikkeller Bangkok any time after 7:30PM and just look for a table with 4 women + 1 guy and come say Hi. It’s BYOB, but I’ll buy a beer for the first couple of guys that come say hi for being good sports!.

Thanks for checking this out!!  PM me if you need any more info. 


Disclaimer: I am not associated in any way whatsoever with Mikkeller Bangkok. I have never been there but heard about it and would like to give it a try.","As a single Thai-American, I do notice there are quite a number of successful professional Thai girls who are still single.

Part of it is because I do think they've lookong for someone of equal social status and sometimes dismiss guys who aren't as successful.

Just thoughts on my own experience. good luck! ",,,
d5uiijx,"Mass isn't a factor? Then why does it take loaded trucks longer to stop than empty trucks? Or doesn't it?

My understanding is that F = m x a

m = mass. More mass = more force. So requires more force in the opposite direction to be stopped. Correct me if I'm wrong.","You are correct, but because the stopping force comes from friction with the ground, the mass cancels out. The force of friction is based on the coeffiecient of friction (μ) and the force of gravity (m x g). Although the truck requires a greater force to slow down due to its larger mass, the force of friction is larger due to the truck's increased mass.",,,

d68wjm6,"The only drugs I have ever taken are alcohol and weed.

The first time I smoked weed I had a slight panic attack I guess you could call it, I was really aware of my elevated heart rate and had to change environment to a dark room for about 5 minutes until I was good and calm again. Since then I have smoked weed at least a 100 times with no problems, except some mild paranoia when smoking in public.

I am very interested in shrooms, but also a bit afraid of it since I have never really had a real psychedelic experience before. I have read a lot about it and of course I intend to take a low dose the first time and make sure the setting is right.

I don't take any medications and I have no family history of schizophrenia .","Seems like you've done some research and have actually thought it out.

dediw8w,"Hang in the buddy. Therapy is AWESOME. I didn't know how to deal with my GAD and depression until I started therapy my senior year..... of college. I partook in unhealthy practices such as drinking and smoking as coping mechanisms. I highly advise you to NOT engage in these activities, especially if you're taking any medication. I went to therapy and stuck to a non-habit forming relationship with weed. I made sure to do my homework first and then I'd let myself blaze. I'm a lot better now, so I don't smoke weed anymore, but it did help as an alternative to anxiety and insomnia meds. Stick to therapy though. Therapy helped me to reorganize thoughts and feelings and project them in a healthy manner. I had a shitty relationship with my parents, but going to therapy and working on myself helped me build a better relationship with them. They're not out to get you! They just want the best for you. Be patient with them and let them know to reciprocate such patience. As with your girlfriend, you need to effectively communicate with her. Say things like ""hey I'm not feeling too great at the moment, is it alright if you listen to me vent for a bit?"" Trust me, it works. I used to get in fights with my girlfriend for this very reason, because I was EXPECTING her to take care of me. You need to be proactive about your mental health and communicate. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a day off, and it's okay to ask for help, especially from your teachers. They are there to help you. Ask your school administration if they can accommodate you for a diagnosis like yours- they almost always will (I'm pretty sure it's the law). Just hang in there buddy! High school is rough, and your brain is changing biochemically, but you need to fight it and I promise you it gets better down the road once you figure everything out. There is no better gift than life. ",I've tried weed and it helps. But I try not to be so caught up with all of the drugs and stuff because I have a really addictive personality. I'll talk to my girlfriend though. I suppose it's partially my fault because I haven't communicated efficiently with her well enough.

dq1i8uk,What exactly is a familiar? And how do you get/ summon one? Are they only astral or do they exist in the material aswell?,"The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit) is quite informative. Whether they are astral or exist in the material world depends on your belief system and which definition of familiar you end up choosing.

As for how to summon one, that too depends on your belief/practice system. Making a cat you already own your familiar as a Wiccan is obviously not the same as summoning a demon of the Goetia known to give good familiars and asking for one. Person A and Person B in those scenarios probably don't even agree on what a familiar is.

Think about what your system is and why you want a familiar, and whether that is honestly right for you. Then do some research. You'll figure it out.",,,

c367h1y,"Mine probably pales in comparison to others, but here it is:


Last summer, I was on my way to a job interview, driving on a mildly congested highway. I was in the right-hand lane, and the driver three or four cars in front of me was driving considerably slowly, and was swerving all over the place. One by one, the drivers in front of me began to pass this seemingly inebriated guy. Soon enough, it was my turn to pass him as well.


I signaled, drove into the passing lane, and moved up parallel to him when he suddenly began to swerve into my lane. In a panic, I laid on the horn and brakes, and jerked the wheel to the left to try to avoid a collision. I then started to spin out-- tires screeching, rising up onto two wheels, consecutive 360s, the whole shebang. I could see and hear other cars swerving, trying to avoid me as well.


I don't know if it was pure luck, my somehow managing to remember what to do in a spin-out (*don't* slam on the brakes or jerk the wheel), or maybe a combination of both, but I somehow miraculously wound up in the ditch dividing both sides of the highway. I didn't hit or injure anyone else, flip over, or hurt myself.


My life didn't flash before my eyes or anything like that, but I remember thinking, ""I'm going to die.""","1.

ctwu67l,"So, I'm a relatively new SD giving this all a try. I'm only really interested in something long-term with a legit connection. Some basics about me: early 40's, fairly attractive, background verified,  allowance on low end of practical, college town.

I've met two girls from the site so far. Went on 3 outings with girl A (coffee meetup, lunch, her place). Started allowance on weekly basis (essentially per meet). No affection, so I ended it on the last outing. I don't think she is a rinser because she was totally (probably foolishly) open with her identity (which is safe with me btw). When I broke it off, she said that she was open to hearing about my needs - but that just seems a little to close to overt sex-for-money for me.

Girl B is in college and new to sugar (so she says). Three meets (coffee, lunch, coffee) but we've really just been getting to know each other - gift cards but no allowance so far - also no affection. She is out of town for a while but says she wants something more regular when she gets back. 

I get the sense that I'm moving things along *way* slower than typical for sugar dating. I wouldn't want the SBs pushing me for money, so I'm not inclined to push for affection. How do the rest of you SDs get things rolling without being pushy?","I think the OP wants to be in a situation where he feels comfortable making a move for sex. Like in regular dating it is up to the woman to give the green light for that move by flirting, touching, appearing to be turned on, or some sort of signal.

dgnr0sj,"&gt; How do you think something like that would affect you?

For the short term, it would be like a nuclear implosion.  A blast of the most stressful emotions a human being is capable of experiencing; only made worse since I would be a child unable to digest my new reality.

I would be in shock at the loss, then mourning, then anger followed guilt because of that anger.

I would lament incessantly every last moment I had with them; even the most minute interaction would be magnified a thousand times and replayed over and over in my head because those moments would never happen again.

Without that foundation, I can't really say what I would become.  I think it would be easy to by cynical of everything, self-medicate and take a backseat on life.

So, with that said, I am saddened by both the loss of your parents and the means at which you lost them; no child should have to experience that level of pain.  

However, you have not let it interfere with the vast amount of opportunities in front of you.

co2jp8l,"It's finally time to buy a bike for myself. I exclusively trail ride and have experience on quads(Last being a 450r). I have borrowed a friends XR200 a couple times and feel pretty comfortable on it and its made me want to buy a bike. 

I really want a 2T, having ridden a friends KTM 250XC-W I feel that a 250 might be a lot to start out on. I'm a die hard Honda fan and am very interested in a CR125. I'm 5'8"" 135lbs. Is a 125 the right bike for me? Will it be a pain in the ass for woods use? I have had countless people tell me 125s are terrible for trails and to look at something else, but with a low budget it seems like a good option to me. 

Thanks for any input!",At your weight a 125 will haul you through woods pretty good. A heavier rider would have to keep the bike in high rpms to keep from stalling it since there is not much low end torque to pull him around at low rpm.  ,,,

Today marks the second week of being pornfree. I never thought I would make it this far, considering my previous lifestyle. I am proud of myself. but boy...is it hard. Every day again I am forcing myself not to visit those familiar sites I have come to love in the past couple of years. The more time passes, the more I ask myself, why the hell am I doing this. I then visit this subreddit or watch the YBOP series and immediately I am determined to finish this 90-day streak. I have noticed some slight improvements after being pornfree, for example women are starting to look better every single day. Simple pictures of a woman with some cleavage I encounter in a magazine for example, excite me more than ever before. Two weeks earlier, such a picture would have been considered too mild and uninteresting. My sexual dreams have not stopped yet, altough they have gotten less. Every now and then my brain will take advantage of my sleep and start firing images of naked women at me. When I wake up and remember my goals, I am in no way tempted to look up porn. I will win this fight. February 5 2013 will mark the end of my streak, if I haven't failed earlier that is. Hopefully next week will be another update.

Today, I ran W3D1.  Outside.  And I failed.  I had to walk half of the second 3-minute jog.  When I got inside and sat down to log my run, I realized why:

16-minute mile walk, **8-minute mile jog**.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to be able to do a full 8-minute mile jog all the time when this C25K business is done.  But right now, I can't handle running that fast.  It hurts my legs and saps me of energy too quickly.

How do you keep the appropriate pace when you're outside?  Now that it's beautiful outside and springtime, I really do want to run outside - but if I can't figure out how to control my pace, I won't be able to.

I have a lot of experience and passions within the industry, but I also know that large-scale youtubing can be kind of mystifying to audience members, and in particular Reddit, who in general tends to have a negative attitude toward certain types of YouTubers.

He accepted, and I started making plans.  However, I got a call from him about 5 minutes later saying that he called my mom's house and my brother answered the phone.

Honestly, comparing Batman to Batman Returns is like comparing your high school girlfriend to your college girlfriend.

You'll always love  your high school girlfriend, but your college girlfriend had Catwoman *and* Danny Davito as Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepott.  And she probably put out more.  What I'm trying to say is Batman Returns was better.

Batman Forever, though...",,,

I live in a relatively small town, thus everybody knows everybody. When someone new comes to our Town, he is usually greeted by everyone, it's basically a News. This time, nobody knew about this guy's arrival. This guy, which I'll refer to as ""Jim"" for privacy, moved to this little place silently, making it strange for people to see a new person around. Why do I say this? Because the first time I saw him, he was leaving with all of his stuff. I tried to talk to him, but as soon as I got near him, he quickly started the car, and got out. 'Cause of the hurry he was in, I guess, he left a couple of boxes in the yard of his house. Not knowing what to do with those boxes, I checked what was in them. He had LOTS of cool stuff. Various NES, N64, Nerd Shirts and, most importantly... Videogames. I checked through them, and he had basically just old games(Sonic, Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong etc...). I know this will sound improbable, but I actually got something out of it. Just a ps2 game (Smackdown!Here Comes The Pain, best WWE game ever) and a N64 game(TLoZ: Ocarina of Time).All of them were on discs with the cover of the game on it. The first one worked flawless, while the second...

The second game had LOTS of graphic bugs, some missons disappeared from the ""Mission's Storyline"", and sometimes the buttons would stop working, and Link would just keep rotating. Funny at first, it became really frustrating, especially during Boss Battles. After defeating King Dodongo, the Emulator crashed. Of course, since I'm a dumbass and forgot to save, I had to restart all over again. After another hour, exactly after beating King Dodongo, the emulator crashed again. I preferred to stop playing this game for a bit, maybe it was an emulator's bug that would eventually be fixed. Today, I started my PC, and tried to play the game. The save I had made the a couple of days ago was replaced by another save. It had a strange name(http://imgur.com/nslXZHa). The game starts from the 4th boss. Don't know why. I went ahed a bit, until I got to the ""Dead Hand"" Boss. After attacking the boss, the game went white screen. I respawned into the Forest, but I still had everything from before. Shortly after, the emulator opened up an error box which said ""The following ROM isn't compatible with your current Windows version (Windows 7 64 bit). Please use older Windows OS, or use compatibility mode. When I try to open it now, it displays this error. Will keep updated.

I'm back with some news! I'd like to thank everybody following this story, Game link is now back up and running for you to check out the rom. I have good, but at the same time bad, news. I explored this rom, and to my surprise, every text was replaced with either ""Shit"" or ""Death"". You can use HxD on the rom to check it out for yourself. Plus, the game didn't work anymore on the Emulator. This makes me think that this ROM is actually a debug rom. But here's the creepiest thing. Last night I swear I dreamed Link in a forest. Nothing creepy, just really weird(probably writing about The Legend Of Zelda isn't helping much). All I know is that I woke up sweaty, and had the feeling of being watched. It's probably my immagination, since I read LOTS of The Legend Of Zelda creepypastas(including Ben). But all of this has really happened to me. Today the game started without errors, unlike yesterday. The title screen was all messed up(http://imgur.com/j747FSw). As soon as I press start, the game brings Link to the first Boss, to whom I can't inflict any damage. after killing me, the game stayed on Link's body for about 40 seconds, 'till the game goes white screen, with the creepy text ""Not ready yet?""(http://imgur.com/FPT0onn). At this point I stayed on this screen for MINUTES. I tried closing and opening the emulator, but as soon as the ROM starts, it shows that same message. If you find a workaround let me know.","I clicked on the imgur link and it was deleted, but I've never seen something like what it showed... Weird",,,

c7gglmt,"I'm always that guy that asks to have it turned up because I'm actually more interested in the show than the petty conversations. With subtitles on, even though there will always be at least one person who makes a negative remark about them, you can have the movie volume at a much lower volume allowing those who want to talk to still hold conversations and those who are watching the movie to be able to follow it.

**EDIT:** Because of the amount of angry messages I've gotten over this LPT, I'd like to clarify. This is something that is best in large groups. I know there are close friends who can actually commit to watching a movie, this doesn't apply to those scenarios. Also, I know a lot of people hate subtitles so please stop telling me. Subtitles are something you have to watch a few movies with and then you are never bothered by them again. If you don't like subtitles, ignore this LPT, don't send me hate mail. Last but not least, like I said, this is just to be considerate to those who might be more interested in the movie than talking to people at any point. Don't play movies that nobody has seen in large groups, just something fun that some people can pay attention to if they want.

**Second LPT:** If you use VLC to watch videos on your computer (which you should), use ""H"" to delay subtitles upwards of a couple seconds so you aren't tempted to read them unless you missed something.

I've tried googling this without any luck.  So I thought I'd come here to you smarty pants fitness whizzes :] 

I have a question about the calories you burn according to your BMR and your active calories.

Do you add the two together to get your total daily calorie expenditure? 
For instance, my BMR is up around 2000 because I'm a big fatty fat (that will change soon) and today my 'active' calories i.e from a gym work out and doing about 11k steps was around 1400. 
Would my expenditure be 3400 for the whole day?

Edit: Thanks so much for your replies so far! I really appreciate them all. I just wanted to clarify since it was mentioned a couple of times that I totally get how shoddy calories reads from machines can be. I use my Apple Watch which seems to be pretty spot on. Can't trust those pesky machines.","No.  Go to IIFYM and check your TDEE - your total daily energy expenditure, which includes your workout calories.

cc7gezu,"I have only recently become intrigued by the BDSM community and I have been doing a lot of homework recently. My experience is very limited - I had a lover whom I was able to give myself over to as a submissive for the first time ever. We experimented with punishment and restraints and it was the time of my life! However, our time together came to an end as we were eventually separated by the Atlantic ocean. For various reasons, long-distance isn't an option. This particular relationship was primarily sexual, which is something I really want to continue to explore. I should also add that I am very intrigued by the idea of chastity, but I am not sure about the logistics of that as a single woman.

However, I know myself enough that I know that I am not quite ready to initiate this kind of relationship, sexual or otherwise, with another person in the immediate future for two reasons: 1) I'm still not feeling 100% available after my most recent relationship and I want to be fair to any future partners. 2) I want to really take my time with anybody new who would be interested in this sort of thing so we can forge a high level or trust and safety. At the moment, I feel like this can only come from somebody I am in some sort of romantic relationship with, although I am open to any other insights and opinions on that matter!

dnkoh9v,"To elaborate on your points now:

You don't see transwomen as equivalent to ciswomen?  Replace equivalent with its synonym of equal and you can see exactly why many of us take great offense with such statements.  At least I hope you can see it.

The whole ""If you're lesbian but won't date transgender women than you're just being transphobic,"" argument is a bit silly.  I understand that.  I don't think you're automatically racist if you find you aren't really attracted to a particular ethnicity either.  The problem lies in the ""WHY.""  As long as why stays physical attraction based and doesn't stem into ""well, I don't think he's really a women,"" then its a non-issue for me.

I don't know  Adichie Chimamanda so I won't comment but I suspect the problem they have is similiar to the first point I had on equal/equivalent.

Yes, saying transwomen are not real women is transphobic and realizing that would go a long ways towards coming to terms with why your labeled a transphobe by some.  What exactly constitutes a real women to you and why are you making it something specifically to exclude a group or women who put up with enough bs as is?  Seriously, answer at least the former part of this question as I would like to continue to discuss it.

Lastly, yes, it is dehumanizing to not validate an identity and no, your opinion on trans issues isn't your identity.  You wanting to invalidate others isn't' some sacred right that they're infringing on when they cry bullshit.

Yet it seems that this is the go-to punishment for people (mostly women, it seems) who do something ""dishonourable"", especially when the dishonour relates to sex/purity.",It's an effective method. Acid attacks are viewed as grievous bodily harm as opposed to attempted homicide so they will recieve less legal repurcussions. The victim will be noticable disfigured to some extent and will greatly suffer right after the attack and have to live with a constant reminder of the attack. Other people are more likely to notice after the victim has recovered in comparison to other methods. Therefore it acts both as a grievous physical punishment without being considered attempted murder and as a psychological threat on the community,,,
cn12byl,"Last night I had a dream about my ex, from about two years ago. Shortly after I broke up with her my depression started, and I haven't felt truly happy, or even like myself, since then. But I thought I was over her entirely.

Then I have this goddamn dream and I'm happier in it than I have been while awake for so long. I never wanted it to end. And when it did, I lay awake in bed, in misery, for a good hour. Today I've felt like a zombie. I've felt so alone. I've wanted to talk about these feelings all day with anyone, but I don't even have anyone to vent my emotions to anymore.

d4ceg1r,"I am trying desperately to find a series that catches my interest as much as the Night Huntress and Night Prince world of Jeaniene Frost, but failing. I've seen some people say that Anita Blake is similar. I'm looking for a book that will keep my interest as I listen to audiobooks on a daily basis while I work. The reason I love Jeaniene Frost is that the romance pulls you through the stories even when the focus is something more grotesque.

I read a review that the first novel in this series takes most of the story to get to even a small romantic scene. Has anyone read both of these series? 

Is it worth me being sucked into what seems to be a 25 book series at this point?

I got sucked into the Chicagoland Vampires series and despite being generally frustrated by most of the books I kept reading because I have a need to finish book series.

cjmm02z,"Hey! I hope you're doing well. A little of my background, I was raised Southern Baptist and was one of those guys who was in church whenever the doors were open. Almost all of my friends ended up going to Christian colleges, but I went to a southern state school and was intimately involved in a large Evangelical student ministry. I asked the same questions as you, and I'll answer them from the perspective of someone who remained in the faith -- I now go to a pretty progressive Episcopalian church.

1) No, the Bible isn't inerrant in the sense that it contains no scientific or historical errors. The folks here will be quick to tell you that. Funny thing is, inerrancy, as now accepted by Evangelicals, is pretty young historically. Look at the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy: it's a reaction to 20th century Christian liberalism, and necessarily relies on the Enlightenment legacy. I like what [Peter Enns](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/11/inerrancy-i-think-someone-forgot-to-tell-the-bible/) has to say about it online and in his books.

2) I don't even know what it means to take the Bible literally... ""If your eye causes you to sin, cast it out."" Well that's *obviously* not literal... but what about the things that aren't so obvious. Plenty of the Bible is poetry and cryptic messages. Also take Proverbs 26:5-6 as an example: ""Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes."" You can't take it literally -- but it's a proverb, a maxim, a wise saying -- not something ever intended to be taken literally.

3) This requires a lot of study, not just with the text, but with people who know the text wayyy better than you. Hopefully your pastor and other leaders know the direction to point you. Let me know if you want any more advice on this -- like I said, it's a lot to learn.

4) I'd take a look at the historical creeds regarding orthodox understandings of the Trinity. Especially the [Athanasian Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed). And forgive me if you've seen this before, but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw) is actually one of the most entertaining explanations of the Trinity I've seen.

I started moving away from conservative Christianity to progressive Christianity through Brian McLaren's [A New Kind of Christian](http://www.amazon.com/New-Kind-Christian-Friends-Spiritual-ebook/dp/B0017T0CN8/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407712610&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=brian+mclaren). I liked Rob Bell's [What We Talk About When We Talk About God](http://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-God-ebook/dp/B0089LOKUS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407712699&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+we+talk+about+when+we+talk+about+god). I'll say that most anything by NT Wright is also good -- and he's still pretty Evangelical.","Thank you for this response. I wanted the post to be tagged serious in order to get cogent dialogue.

cn1cy8f,"It's true she might just want to be friends. I think that if you are out on a date, it would be obvious that you are trying to get in a relationship with her, so she would be receptive to that, and less likely to be walking around with you thinking it's just two friends hanging out. Does that make sense? I'm not sure if I explained it clearly. Like, if you are on a date, she knows it's a date, and will try to be thinking about dating you. Maybe afterwards she might decide she doesn't want to be more than friends.

Also, before I loved my boyfriend or any of my exes, really, they were my best friend first. Cliché, probably. But I could talk to them about anything, and that's why we dated. So like... If you hit it off on your date and be really friendly and stuff, ask her if she'd like to go out again. I guess... Sort of try to slip into a relationship rather than make that the first thing you are trying to do. Try not to be too afraid of not getting a second date because it will happen a lot in your lifetime.

I don't think I mentioned anything about the physical aspect. If the time comes and she seems to want you to kiss her, do it! Just go for it. The worst that can happen is she won't want to date you (isn't that already happening?) so it can't really hurt! But don't feel bad if it doesn't happen. I didn't kiss my boyfriend until like 2 or 3 weeks in because I have emotional problems. If a girl is shy or something, just take it slow. Hopefully you are good at judging and reading people!

I have a few options (details/links below), but it comes down to 3 used models of varying price, miles, and features, and one new car of last year's model (a 2015). My current plan is to check out the used vehicles to make sure they are in good enough shape, then basically talk to each seller and say ""I am lookin at three others, whats your best price"", and then decide on one after I get their prices and consider the conditions/features of each car. 

So my questions are:

* Is buying a new car of last year's model a good way to go (regardless of my situation)?
* After reading thru this sub's FAQ's, it seems that the prices are unlikely to budge more than a few hundred, is that still the case?
* Will the plan of asking people for their lowest prices then just go off that going to work? Or should I just negotiate more directly with each dealer?
* Overall thoughts? Advice for Jeep Wranglers in particular?

Actually, this post/comment really helped me. I met this guy abroad, thought it was perfect because we were both creative types (it's hard to find people that really get it I suppose, let alone in a foreign country...) so I thought this would be my man for life.


Then began a cycle... he would break up with me... he would find some reason to get mad (I went on a day trip with my best fiends without him-he dumped me; I performed my first show as the singer of this band, said I'd be interested in doing a song with another band-he dumped me; etc etc **He essentially saw himself as the perfect boyfriend so if I did anything to upset him, I was an unworthy girlfriend.**), end it, then decide to get back together. Sometimes multiple times a month! Then I completely buckled. I just became this hopeless wreck, desperate to please him, always on eggshells, never ever deeply comfortable with living my own life. I stopped seeing my friends because they were a ""bad influence."" I stopped exploring Korea and spent all my free time with him. I quit the band. Etc etc.

He told me that his anger was because of Korea, that he would be happier in his own country. But it was worse. He couldn't find a job; reverse culture shock;... just, everything. 

And now he is essentially demanding we go abroad again. And I don't want to. It was miserable to be with him for a lot of that experience abroad, there's no way I'm going back to that.

Like you, this toxic relationship has to end. And I know how you feel. **We have been so beaten down by these men, made to believe that we aren't worthy, that we are worthless...**

**But we are not.** 

And this IS a clean slate. This is your chance to learn how to be your own person. And you CANNOT let yourself be entirely dependent on some ""other half"" because that is bs. That ""other half"" should not complete you; we have to complete ourselves. We have to enjoy our own lives. 

Please stop waiting for this guy to make you happy. I'm right there with you. My ex and I had moments that were comfortable and even good, but this is not a death sentence. There *will* be others. But the focus should not be on that right now. You are about to complete all these new adventures... Focus on that.

Uruguay's progressive history was [summarised](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1tes9b/the_economists_country_of_the_year_uruguay_for/ce7flc8).

And an Uruguayan citizen [attempted to offer a balanced view](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1tes9b/the_economists_country_of_the_year_uruguay_for/ce7hwb9).

EDIT: For the benefit of the will-to-click-impaired, here are the above comments inlined:

**History summarised** (from /u/Enchilada_McMustang):

&gt; A bit of historical background:

&gt; In the early 20th century Uruguay under president Jose Batlle y Ordoñez became one of the first countries in the world to introduce the following social reforms:

&gt; - 8 hour workday law
- Ban of child labour of children under 13
- Restrictions on labour for those under 19
- Right to strike action
- Social security laws
- Divorce law
- Legal protection to illegitimate children
- Separation of church and state
- Secret vote
- Women's vote

&gt; All these reforms took place between 1907 and 1919.

&gt; [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batllism)

**A balanced view** (from /u/alvaroing12):

&gt; Uruguayan citizen and resident here!

&gt; I am very happy to see my country taking the lead on such important issues as egalitarian marriage and cannabis. However, I feel the need to express that the extreme praise President Mujica is receiving lately is quite exaggerated.
While, actually, most of the real work to pass said laws has been done by NGO's along with members of the Uruguayan Parliament.

&gt; In addition to that, while having the strong views for which he is known for, Mujica's administration has been quite weak in solving long overdue issues as the terrible decline in our public education system (formerly known for its quality) as well as the rising of crime and the alarming situation of our penitentiary system.

&gt; Furthermore, something really sad is the fact that as of yesterday (21/12/2013) the Minister of Economy and Finance - Fernando Lorenzo- was forced to resign his position due to corruption allegations regarding the fraudulent selling of the state-owned airline PLUNA (often referred as the ""Plunagate"" case), in which Mujica, despite not proven of being directly involved, was certainly aware of the ill-nature of the Minister's deeds and did nothing about it.

&gt; With this comment, I don't mean to undermine the achievements of the current administration but try to offer a balanced view of Uruguay and our government.

&gt; I am really proud of calling myself an Uruguayan, but I believe the best for our country is not to eternally praise ourselves in our past achievements, but keep on working hard.

Pick 2

Lamar Miller vs. Ten

Joe Mixon @ CLE

Javorius ""Buck"" Allen vs. PIT

Tarik Cohen @ GB

Buck is my number 1 right now, the matchup against PIT looks juicy. Tarik should fare well against a Packers team that has been exploited by pass-catching backs. Mixon is finally getting his and get a Browns team that stuffed Le'Veon, but got run over by Allen/West. And then there's Lamar Miller, mediocrity and all.

Thoughts?","I would definitely start Cohen in any PPR format. With 8 catches being his floor, it seems safe to play him and if he gets a breakout play for a touchdown it's great. I agree with the Allen assessment since it should be a more passing oriented game. 

Mixon should fare well this week, but he's only staring to get a majority share of the snaps. He may go off this week, but that's a risk I wouldn't take. I would not start Miller with the other options available. ",,,

Any advice would be great. If anyone else has had luck being admitted with a lower cGPA please feel free to give me advice.

Stats:

cGPA: 3.0 (likely ~3.1/3.2 at time of app due to in prog. credits)

sGPA: ~3.85 

GRE: Not taken yet, but consistently scoring 310+ on pre-tests.

HCE: ~3000 hours Group Home/Inpatient Psychiatry

Volunteer Hours: My goal is to get 100 hours Tutoring underprivileged kids/Big Brother mentor this semester

Shadowing: Will be about 20/30 hours shadowing a cardiothoracic surgeon and his PAs. 

Research: 2 semesters in a neuroscience lab as an undergrad researcher

Collateral Info: Bilingual in Spanish, 6 months Study abroad in Spain

dg4fnjq,"The more complicated backstory, the better!

I often try some character related words or concepts in other languages when I make character names. Latin is one of my favorites for this but not the only one. Google translate ftw!

I used to play WoW a few years back and my favorite character name ever is my WoW druid, **Odilimax**. For any of you that haven't played it, WoW druids are shapeshifters and can transform into bears and some other forms.

There is a children's TV show in Sweden about a bear (man in a teddy bear suit) that lives in an abandoned warehouse with his friends; a wooden dog called Hugo, a hobbyhorse and a snail plushy simply called Snail. Every single swede knows this show, ""Björnes Magasin"". It translates roughly to ""Bear's Warehouse""

A Swedish radio show made a parody of the TV show. At the start of each episode, the gullible Bear explains that Hugo couldn't come because he had to [do some very suspicious sounding stuff]. So Bear and Snail set out on adventures but it always ends with Snail getting Bear into trouble with the law or great physical pain. Every episode ends with Bear saying ""I hate Snail!"", which in latin is ""Odi Limax"".

c1bey9u,"*  Sometimes I get paranoid about whether I am being too familiar with people or not.  Then when it comes to interacting with said people I am paralyzed with indecision and an unnatural fear of connecting emotionally.

*  Other times, I make-believe / think that I am a retarded person who is unaware that he is retarded, and that other people are just humoring me because I am retarded.  Then I get paranoid about that.

*  I have this weird thing where, if I over-eat, a specific spot deep in my left shoulder will ache, signaling my over-indulgence.  This, coupled with the fact that I feel that, over the years, my ability to enunciate my words has slowly deteriorated, makes me wonder if I've been having mini-strokes every time I over-eat.  I haven't really checked it out, because I kind of like the fact that I fear over-eating.

EDIT:    

*  Inevitably, I become aware of the fact that I am not connecting enough while conversing with others. I then step up outward expression of enthusiasm and interest until it seems appropriate. My outward manifestations of enthusiasm begin to ignite a genuine interest and I begin to spiral out of control. Soon, I am so enthusiastic and invested in a conversation / relationship / friendship that people begin to be put off by my enthusiasm.

do7jhuh,"The term you're looking for is custom ROMs, not rooting. Rooting is pretty much the jailbreak of the android world. It's used to attain privileged control over the android subsystem. Rooting should be avoided unless you know exactly what you're doing, as it makes your device vulnerable to malware attacks without proper precautions.

Installing custom ROMs is a way to ensure you're always on top of android os and security updates. The android developer community always comes up with brilliant ROMs like Lineage/RR/AOSPX..

As for your concern, if you update to a new android version via a custom ROM, the LG UI won't be back. The only way to get that UI back is if you revert back to stock which I don't think you're looking to do anyway.

One thing to note is that if you decide to install custom ROMs, your device's warranty flies out of the window. Also unlocking your device also carries a significant risk, that is you can brick it or put it into bootloop.

If despite all these potential problems, you still wanna install custom ROMs, go for the LG.

However if you want to enjoy android os and security updates for the next three years without having the headache of installing custom ROMs, go for the pixel.","Oh wow, I wasn't even aware of ROMs and they sound excellent. Thanks!",,,

daycadc,"First I want to say this is EXTREMELY common behavior. Even with Reddit's sad excuse for a search engine you can find lots of examples of people doing similar behavior to them. This all boils down to the simple fact that people fear change.

They do not know why they do this and if you asked them, then they will almost certainly turn it back to you. example: 

""I will just box this up and eat the rest later""

""What are you sick""

""What makes you think that?""

""You are not eating your food""

"" I am just going to take the rest home and eat it when I am hungry""

""You are obsessed with dieting, it is so stupid.""

Notice how you are talking about yourself and they are always talking about you and not them? That is a person responding to YOU changing but they do not understand why they are concerned by it. So what you should do is ask them why they care. Be polite, be honest in your wanting to know what your dieting does to them. Then when you question that way address what is the matter with them.

""You are obsessed with dieting it is so stupid""

""I am just eating a little less, why is that concerning to you?""

""Well I am just concerned that you may take this to an unhealthy place""

""I am following a dieting plan to be a healthy person not a skinny one. I am taking care of myself""

Do you have time to prepare meals/lunches in advance? Like make a big batch of lasagna and freeze for future meals? Might reduce your grocery bill without sacrificing the quality of food you enjoy.

If you have a rice cooker /crock pot and an outlet timer ($3-$10 from a hardware store) you can set it to have rice cooked when you get home, or set it up for hot steal-cut oatmeal in the mornings for breakfast.

cwh9vp1,"Definitely wouldn't mind an atheist attending my church!

The only question I have is, what sort of meaningful community do you expect to encounter? The close-knit friendships I've gained through the church are due in no small part to the message of Christ and how we pursue it together, how much we value growth and humility. I'm not saying these aren't values you two can have as well, but if you expect to gain meaningful couple-friends it won't be long before you're having to fake it or come out. After that, I'd only hope that your new friends are gracious and humble enough not to inundate you with conversion attempts. But know that they may find it difficult not to. 

If you're posting on here, and have such conviction in your atheism that you see converting as a nil chance, you probably have plenty of personal philosophies on how to live morally, how marriage and communication can be effective despite our penchant towards self-service, etc. A more pragmatic, non-religious language, view of these traits may actually spur lots of great conversation or help your new christian friends to see things from a new perspective. The key will be humility on both sides :D","I like to think I value growth and humility as well, I just take a different path to get there. Someone calls themself a sinner, I just say I'm human.

dreo851,"Hey! Love your username- I also had massive boobs. Oh, the irony. 

When I first found out, I cried a lot. I was super scared. I was really worried about pain and vomiting after surgery. Here’s the trick. Tell your anesthesiologist you get very sick after surgery and you want all the nausea drugs. Always stay ahead of pain, take pills before the pain comes, and never on an empty stomach. Plan a Netflix binge and eat like you recently had the stomach bug. It’s really not bad at all, I promise!

The reconstruction part depends on how much skin the oncologist leaves after the mastectomy part- if you are going large to small you have a better chance. Do you know the size? Also how oxygenated the skin looks after he’s done will affect whether or not they think you can get immediate recon. It’s good and bad: you can’t get them? Easier, shorter surgery, and another easy short one later! Get both? Great. It’s a win win! 

I feel phenomenal now! Seriously no biggie. These people know what they’re doing and really are so helpful. It’s ok to be sad- DONT google image. Your new boobs will look amazing . I had a breast reduction in July to make the surgery less intense and for a better aesthetic result- went down to the size implants I wanted. Then we did both surgeries last Tuesday. I got silicone reconstruction and kept the nipples. Seriously they already look so good. I channeled my fear into healthy energy and bravery. Whenever I got sad, I’d listen to a bad ass song and run. Or I’d do something nice to fill my time- I volunteered and taught a GED class. Anxiety is unavoidable and it sucks, but it’s a completely useless feeling.

crd0fwc,"All of them. If you have yoga and are looking to expand past repeating the same sequence of moves then you should look into the more modernized arts.

It is a very humbling experience. I also mentioned that you should train all of them, or as many as you can find. There is no such thing as a complete art, they all have holes in their systems.

Plus, his double gold medal haul with Nicholson, Lowe and Chiarelli would similarly function as forming an executive-management-coaching spine.

While I train and focus on these skills would it be a good idea to practice my back tuck and slant gainer (going for extra height) and if so would 4-5 attempts every other day be effective at maintaining and/or improving them?

There have times where I continue to masturbate after reaching orgasm. There is usually extra sensitivity but its only a slight discomfort, not enough to force me to stop. Anyways, if I continue long enough I feel like I may orgasm again, but instead of the usual semen-mixture I release a stream of, what I think is, pee. It feels sort of like a very, very diluted orgasm, but an orgasm nonetheless. I've experimented in the shower and the pee? comes out indefinitely as long I continue to masturbate. I've tried to Google this but I've come up with nothing. 

My question is, is this normal?","I have jacked off, orgasmed, then peed, then jacked off again, orgasmed again, then peed and jacked of and kept going for two more orgasms without peeing in the middle of the orgasms one night.

cfazsc9,"Hello. I am Mr. Regular, the voice and co-writer for Regular Car Reviews. This is a link to our Fund Anything Campaign. 

http://fundanything.com/en/campaigns/regular-car-reviews-roadtrip

The mods want you to know that I have not and will not solicit donations from you in threads or in private messages.

Edit 1: 7:30pm 2/5/2014.....
$1,159 already? 

Edit 2: 9:37pm 2/5/2014..... $5,709...My hands are shaking. It is hard to use the mouse correctly. Our goal is reached in under two hours? How? I set that Fund Anything campaign to run for over a month. Surely, a month would be enough time to raise 5K, but...TWO HOURS? I am full of FEELINGS! Thank you Thank you Thank you! 

Edit 3: 9:40pm 2/5/2014.... $5,744... What do I do? Kind folks are still helping. Do I let it run? 

Edit 4: 9:56pm 2/5/2014.... $6,229... *Shakes* I feel weird. Thank you! You've paid for a replacement car and then some. &lt;3 &lt;3 What is good reddiqute here? Shut it down? I mean, people want to help. We didn't think our silly little videos meant so much to so many people! &lt;3

Edit 5: 10:03pm 2/6/2014 ....$12,678... Last night, I was unsure what to do. On Monday, my only car was ruined and I was looking at the wall behind my monitor, not really focusing on anything. I was wondering how I walked away from an accident like that. I'm alive because Toyota makes even their cheap cars safe in crashes. I go outside, video my car with my Nikon D5000, and record a voice-over. On Tuesday, I post the video. All of you take it and carry it above your shoulders. You convince The Roman and I to start some kind of donation effort. We set up a FundAnything page. I never did something like this before, so kept all the settings at default. The Campaign was set to 40-something days so that's were it stayed. ""If that's the average length, there is no sense messing with it,"" I thought. The page goes up Wednesday night. In two hours you shoved us right to a goal that I thought would take a month. I didn't know how to feel other than explosive love! I was simultaneously still grieving my car while being pumped full of joy!  It was a FLOOD of FEELINGS! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  It is an eruption of Thank-You's flying in all directions! 

I went to bed early because I had to wrangle a ride to work this morning (Thursday). I check the Fund Anything Page and it is over $10,000. It was unreal looking at that number. This is what it feels like when the whole car community (and beyond) rescues you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg4CPaKzSUU

I got to work this morning and pretended it was a normal day. My boss told me he's sorry about my car. He likes cars too and has a BMW 200 that he is piecing together. He asked if I am able to replace my Echo. I paused and said: ""I'll be alright."" My boss walked back to his table and calls to me. ""If you need anything...just ask!"" I leaned back down the hall. ""I'll be good!"" 


A few hours ago I got back home. I looked at my computer but didn't turn it on. Guilt crept in. ""I don't deserve this,"" I thought. Turning around, I gathered gym clothes, shoes and my Sanza Clip (yep). I borrowed another car, a Honda Accord (Business Accounts), and went to my gym. 

Treadmills are a good way to clear your head. I thought a lot about how you really haven't given us a gift, you've given us a loan. I am paraphrasing an old Simpsons episode here: ""I'm no marketer. I don't know who or what the Internet/Reddit is exactly. All I know is they are a force more powerful than you or I put together...and you owe them BIG.""

Regular Car Reviews must double-down and get better. You've demonstrated, with relentless mirth, that you want us to thrive! Thank you so much! You really believe we can become ... I don't know what...pioneers? Whatever it is, wherever we are going, we're going there because of you! 

In all this mirth, there is one little question. Should we close the campaign? I don't know. While plodding along on the mill, I thought of the one man who has given ME free entertainment for years and who also ran a successful crowd-funding campaign using FundAnything. I bought the products he promoted on his podcast and always clicked-though his Amazon link when buying motorcycle and car parts: Adam Carolla. He used FundAnything to raise money for his independent movie Road Hard and he met his goal and then some. He too boxed with the touchy subject of leaving a campaign open after the goal was reached. The Ace Man said something to the tune of ""The Internet Gods will decide how much resources you need, not you."" 

We have, in my eyes, more than enough money to buy a car and roam from coast to cost for two weeks (This June, God-Willing). Weather we need more than 12K is entirely up to you. 

Thank you enormously from my brain's heart (obscure reference),

As a beginner, I spent more time watching videos of how to do things than really doing things (not right, I know) and by doing that I've seen dozens of workflows methods and never get decide of which one is for me.

Sometimes I start a music in my clip view (Ableton User). I do all the stuffs I want in my music and then I go to the arrangment view. But this is not my default process, you know? There are a few days I start from the middle of the song, days that I start with the drums and days I can't even start, because every different course starts in a way, and watching all those videos make me lose my mind and do nothing.

c1rwye4,"&gt; What is wrong with us?

We're selfish; we're stupid.

On a personal level, most of us spend our whole lives wrapped up in inane, socially-constructed games of little real importance or utility. We value status, money and ego far more highly than technological progress. 99% of us will never be able to find a cause we can believe in that's any larger or more important than our own infantile self-gratification.

On a larger scale, we're too busy making wars and killing each other over the slightest and most insignificant of differences to make much progress on just about anything else. And all the resources we waste in that fashion (the amount is *fucking enormous*) are flushed down the toilet, and can't be used to do things with tremendous potential to make the world a far better place. To take only the latest and most egregious example that springs to mind: We're [spending $11 billion *per month*](http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/25/shared-sacrifice-war-taxes-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html) on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, a [fusion reactor design made by one of the best physicists in history can barely get funding at all.](http://www.emc2fusion.org/) $7 mil one time seems to be the best they can do. The website has to beg for donations.

Even small, simple problems whose technological solutions we already have are still utterly beyond our abilities. In the 1960's we could send (several) men to the moon and back, but even in 2010 people still starve to death right here on earth every day. Because, you know, airdropping vitamins, beef jerky and gatorade to starving people is JUST TOO MUCH WORK.

We are one stupid, short-sighted, pathetic, useless bunch of [poorly-evolved monkeys.](http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html)

And frankly, when we go extinct, I won't shed a single fucking tear... Humanity makes me pro-nuclear. ","...Are you me?

The fact we spend so much money on war and improving phones instead of improving lifes and health, it baffles me we could do so much more in the past than we can now.

cbo5bd8,"Michael Jackson was castrated and was basically a castrato.

I don't remember where I heard this, but I believe Michael Jackson was castrated at a young age, and it was probably ordered by his father, Joe Jackson.

Joe Jackson would do anything to make money off his kids, and Michael was the most profitable of the lot. Unfortunately, Michael Jackson's claim to fame was partly his high voice, so to keep him from going through puberty, Joe Jackson had him castrated.

REASONING:

-His dad was an abusive, greedy man.

-His voice remained high until his death. His brothers' voices all got deeper.

-Michael Jackson claimed he never had sex. If he was not equipped for it, he wouldn't even want to. Furthermore, his children are not biologically his.

-He was really, really weird, and his obsession with childhood might not have come from wanting a childhood he never had, but it might stem from the fact he never left childhood.

Edits: changed ""chemically castrated"" to just plain ""castrated"" and changed ""Evidence"" to ""Reasoning""",If he was castrated would he still have any sex drive? I only ask because I red an invoice of all of the pornography that was found in his house a few months ago. I think it was on the front page actually.

d3lyjvp,"Hi! This is a form of ocd and exactly what you describe are very classic hallmarks of csp/ocd.  Alas!  Our minds trick us in the moments we are picking.  For me knowing that the moments I am engaging in picking and thinking its helping my skin, I am not thinking rationally because of this disorder.  CSP is a liar and holding that thought in my mind if I begin to pick stops me sooner.  If I  hold that rational thought at the moment I begin I do far less damage and stop far sooner!  Keep the good angel on your shoulder to do battle with the irrational thinking of the picking syndrome - keep it there while you are tempted to pick or have begun picking.  Overtime, this strategy has truly helped me and has progressively(step by step) slowly lessened my picking and coninues to.  

Of course,  reading everything you can abou csp, trying out the strategies mentioned and getting therapy (if you can afford it) are also critical to getting better.  OCD affects about 2% of the population and of those who have it about 25% also have CSP!  So we are not alone in battling this disorder.!!  I wish you all the best in your own battle!!  Also, I pray (as in religious prayer) when I start to pick that I think rationally and stop and that helps me to stop much sooner.  I am not urging anyone to do that, it just helps me. 😊

Last night my BFF posted a nice ""congrats on your engagement"" post with a nice caption.

Her: umm, are you pregnant?!

Secondly- She is projecting her insecurities on to you. PLEASE do not listen to that mess.

cfbhruk,"Hi reddit, I'm in need of some advice. It’s a bit long, but I’d really appreciate the help.

My girlfriend (19) and I (20M) have been dating for about a year and three months. We started having sex about two weeks prior to us dating, and for the first six months, we had sex around 5-10 times a week. Things slowed down after that until we reached a 2 month period without sex, then a 1 month period. When things were looking grim we had some great sex around our anniversary, but the holidays came and now we just had a 2.5 months no-sex period. That ended the other night, but she was rushed for time and it ended up being really quick and dissatisfying to both parties.

It’s worth mentioning that prior to our relationship, she has had around 9 different sexual partners. I on the other hand, lost my virginity to her. One of her major concerns throughout our relationship has been that I would cheat on her due to my lack of sexual experience compared to hers, and she even mentioned that if we would ever get married, she would allow a “free weekend” so that I could get it out of my system. She’s always been upfront about me being her best boyfriend she’s ever had, both in personality and sexually.

In the beginning she often was the one to initiate, but in the last year it’s been almost all me. And countless times I’ve been turned down by the “I’m too tired” and “I’m too stressed” excuses. When she says this I always try to understand, but I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t know if it’ll change and I always feel bad when she turns me down. My sex drive has continued to be strong throughout our relationship, and it’s gotten to the point where every time we hang out I’m hoping the stars will align and she’ll be in the mood. 

I had confronted her about it last fall, but she was offended. I tried to approach it from the direction that as a young, fit college student in his prime, I want to be having plenty of sex and that if we continue to not have sex, I may become dissatisfied with our relationship. She cited school stress and issues with a little weight gain as the culprit of her low sex drive and scolded me for my efforts. 

Fast forward to two days after our disappointing end to our 2.5 month streak, and I ask her if she wants to have sex tonight. We just got done having a fun weekend with one another, and she seemed more energetic than usual. She says she doesn’t feel like it, then admits to not enjoying herself the other night, saying “I felt nothing”. She then brings up that maybe she’s had too much sex, quoting maybe “1,000 times” and “10 different partners”, including me. Not necessarily something I want to hear, as my number obviously pales in comparison. She adds that she hasn’t watched porn in over a month (something she once did frequently), and that she just doesn’t feel like it anymore. I bring up Valentine’s Day, and she unconvincingly said “maybe”. The conversation ended in silence after I mention that that’s concerning to me and I find it a problem. She didn’t have the appalled reaction that she had last time we had this talk, but more of a “that’s the way it is, sorry” reaction.

What steps should I take next? I would really like to stay together if at all possible, but I don't know if I can continue like this for another 6 months. Thank you for any and all advice.","Okay. I come from pretty much the same history except earlier. I'm 17 and about 2 years ago had sex for the first time. Me and her were together for awhile and had a lot of sex. Over that time I realized how little sex really means. If it's that big a deal you have sex, I'd just like to wish you luck in further relationships.",,,

- Contrast contrast contrast! That word is one of the most important ones you'll ever hear when it comes to music. Make sure that your breakdowns contrast to your beats to your builds etc etc. In terms of width, volume, frequency, and anything else you can think of. 

- Your only issue (in my opinion) is that you haven't created quite enough space. It's a great and interesting tune, but it lacks breathing room, which I think is important. Consider some more parts that are less complex and in-your-face to help give people a sense of dynamic.

[**The Paladin**](http://imgur.com/a/5WrUh)

The Hoods color matches the armour's trimming and hopefully brings it all together.  Paired with a Knight's Shield and Red pommel of the Knight's Sword (to match the crest on your armour) and you're good to go.  Good for some classic righteous Knight-ing.  Also, dye the armour crimson red and swap out the Hood for a Diamond Circlet for royal, princely look.

**Head**: Hylian Hood (Light Yellow)

**Body**: Soldier's Armor (Blue)

**Legs**: Soldier's Greaves (Blue)

**Equipment**: Knight's Sword + Knight's Shield

[**Alternative**: The Royal Knight with a Diamond Circlet and Crimson Armor and Greaves)

__________

[**Ronin**](http://imgur.com/a/6CROH)

A wandering Samurai of sorts, I love the look of this but remember: no shields.  Samurai didn't have shields.  The Eightfold Longblade's special charging strike really makes this one come alive.

**Head**: Desert Voe Headband (Black)

**Body**: Stealth Chest Guard (Black)

**Legs**: Sand Boots (Black)

**Equipment**: Eightfold Blade / Eightfold Longblade

__________

[**Highlander**](http://imgur.com/a/2byy9)

Interestingly enough, the brown Snow Boots' light blue trimmings match the Light Blue Armour perfectly.  Coupled with a Ruby Circlet gives this a Conan the Barbarian-esque look.  Grab a two hander and off you go with this all-or-nothing, battle-in-your-face, who-needs-a-plan class that practical speaks for itself.

**Head**: Ruby Circlet

**Body**: Barbarian Armor (Light Blue)

**Legs**: Snow Boots (Brown)

**Equipment**: Claymore / Double Axe / Traveller's Sword + Shield

__________

[**Ranger**](http://imgur.com/a/jrnEQ)

Probably my longest used outfit (hence all the pictures).  I love how this looks worn and practical but still very cool.  No fancy bows, though - Rangers are hunters, survivalists and scavengers; their weapons are often of their own making and more often than not wood.  They favour Quick Draw bows and use them even in close range combat.  No metal, no shields or sword.  They stay light, move quietly and fight from a distance with planning and strategy.

**Head**: Hylian Hood (Brown)

**Body**: Hylian Tunic (Brown)

**Legs**: Hylian Trousers (Navy Blue)

**Equipment**: Deku Bow, Wooden Bow

__________

[**Ex. Knight**](http://imgur.com/a/hjgzy)

My favourite outfit in the game; a retired, veteran knight.  The white and blacks might seem pretty simple at first but with the bright blues of the Knight's Sword's scabbard and the Hylian Shield, it all comes together (along with the red highlights in the shield and on his vest).  Very cool look, and high defensive rating as well.  Tiny climbing boost to boot.  An all rounder gear of a last knight in a world without knights.  (Threw in some other color variations as well!)

**Head**: Amber Earrings

**Body**: Climbing Gear (White)

**Legs**: Soldier's Greaves (Black)

**Equipment**: Knight's Sword + Hylian Shield

__________

[**Dragoon**](http://imgur.com/a/CoAir)

Inspired by the famous Final Fantasy series' class, Dragoons are elite soldiers with very distinct armour sets and who specialize in spears, lances and polearms and a piercing style of combat.  Dragoons also benefit from slight lightning resistances and increased swimming speed, though they don't wield bows/arrows.  The various colors represent the various brigades who each favour a particular kind of pole arm that (wouldn't you know) matches their outfit...

**Head**: Rubber Helm (Light Blue)

**Body**: Zora Armor (Light Blue)

**Legs**: Soldier's Greaves (Black)

**Equipment**: Spears, Polearms

__________

[**Ghibli Hero**](http://imgur.com/a/3zDiD)

One part a reference to Prince Ashitaka (from Princess Mononoke, one of the game's inspirations and references), one part civilian clothes.  The blue in the shirt matches Link's eyes and offsets his hair nicely; it just oozes Ghibli.  This has always been my go-to town-wear and the quiet white, blue and blonde seems to come right out of the hands of Miyazaki and his 3-color approach to simple, memorable character designs.

**Head**: Nothing

**Body**: Old Shirt (Blue)

**Legs**: Hylian Trousers (White)

**Equipment**: None, Wooden Bow

__________

[**Onion Knight**](http://imgur.com/a/gSVwD)

A stoic (if somewhat bumbling) knight who's heart is in the right place but trouble seems to find him as often as adventure.  He's not shy about using his patented retreat strategy (sprinting and screaming) but when he stands to fight, it's often for a noble cause.  Unfortunately, we can't change the color of the Flamebreaker Helm's main components so I went with brown to draw everything together.  An alternate version with a Brown Soldier's Armor also works, although it tends to slim him up a bit when I look him more Seignmeyer and...oniony.

**Head**: Flamebreaker Helm (Brown)

**Body**: Flamebreaker Armor (Brown)

**Legs**: Trousers of the Wild (Brown)

**Equipment**: Cobble Crusher, Boulder Breaker, Spring Loaded Hammer

__________

**Head**: Topaz Earrings

**Body**: Rubber Amor (White)

**Legs**: Rubber Tights (Blue)

**Equipment**: Ancient Weapons, Guardian Weapons

[**Blue Tunic (Link to the Past)**](http://imgur.com/a/z8F5i)

You know it.  I didn't expect it to work so well but, surprisingly, these colors work together really nicely (though the red tunic colors don't translate quite so well.)  Once I decided to give this a try, I haven't really gone back: I love the look.  No Hylian Shield here; the Gerudo Shield (instead) looks closest to the kind of art design in the shields of that game and the Feathered Edge is short, wide and squat enough to make the outfit really feel like it should.

**Head**: Cap of the Wild (Light Yellow)

**Body**: Tunic of the Wild (Blue)

**Legs**: Trousers of the Wild (Light Yellow)

**Equipment**: Feathered Edge, Gerudo Shield 

__________

[**Shinobi**](http://imgur.com/a/EXSAg)

One of my favourite looks; the Demon Carver rims the Soldier's Shield near perfectly and all the colors match a deep midnight and gray look that I just love.  I never tire of unsheathing these weapons; the way Link just pulls apart what looks like a contraception into distinct weapons is just so cool.  Plus, it's a Ninja in modern sneakers with a Tron vibe; what's *not* to love?

**Head**: Stealth Mask (Navy Blue)

**Body**: Rubber Armor (Navy Blue)

**Legs**: Rubber Tights (Navy Blue)

**Equipment**: Demon Carver, Soldier's Shield

[**The Night's Watch**](http://imgur.com/a/x9sWB)

Right out of Game of Thrones (**warning: heavy GoT spoilers**).  And, like the men of the Night's Watch, they are underfunded, under equipped and overwhelmed.  Weak bows, no shields, and *very* low defence on the outfit.  Even the Warm Doublet isn't enough to stand the colds North of North.  Luckily, our Hero here is Azor Ahai reborn, and his great flaming sword not only fells most cold enemies in one blow, but helps to warm him when things get really bad.  This is a risky outfit that makes the world dangerous (your weapon is also what's stopping the cold from consuming you) and as the white walkers close in around you, all you've left to fend them off is a burning sword and the knowledge that you *are* the shield that guards the realm of men...

**Head**: Hylian Hood (Black)

**Body**: Warm Doublet (Black)

**Legs**: Snow Boots (Black)

**Equipment**: Flamesblade, Wooden Bow/Soldier's Bow

__________

[**One Punch Hero**](http://imgur.com/a/cW6O1)

I don't think I need to explain this one.  You either get it completely or you don't at all.  And yes, the Stealth Mask could have also worked but it just doesn't feel as Saitama with his face covered...

**Head**: Hylian Hood (White)

**Body**: Radiant Shirt (Yellow)

**Legs**: Radiant Tights (Yellow)

**Equipment**: Spring Loaded Hammer

[**Postman**](http://imgur.com/a/Mec3B)

The classic sprinting hero of Hyrule messaging.  A red Zora Helm probably works better as a cap but the Ancient helm just *feels* more official.  I tried a variety of spears to try and get that flag look and, in the end, decided the stem of the Guardian Axe just *worked*.  Plus it matched the helm.  I love this outfit because it gives me the urge to just start hand people anything and everything.  And sprint.  Lots of sprinting.

**Head**: Ancient Helm (Red)

**Body**: Climbing Gear (White)

**Legs**: Trousers of the Wild (White)

**Equipment**: Guardian Axe ++

__________

[**Icarus**](http://imgur.com/a/itPQ7)

Or Hermes, if you like; you'll get the look I was going for when you see it.  There's no other weapon to go for other than the Falcon Bow and the Lightning Rod (though the Thunderblade and Radiant Shield make sense too); you're a demi god after all.  Just equipping this outfit makes the game *feel* different; like you're lighter, can move faster, shoot further, jump higher.  I've experimented with a bunch of colors and felt these worked the best and I really like how it came out in the end.

**Head**: Snowquill Headdress (White)

**Body**: Desert Voe Spaulder (White)

**Legs**: Barbarian Leggings (Light Blue)

**Equipment**: Great Falcon Bow, Lightning Rod

**Hyrule Warriors Link** (Green Hylian Hood, Green Hylian Tunic, Standard Hylian Trousers) - meant to resemble Hyrule Warriors' version of Link

**Linkson** (Light Yellow Climbing Bandana, Standard Climbing Gear, Pink Hylian Trousers) - inspired by the lovely Dodson and Co.  You can go Light Yellow Trousers and Pink Bandana if you like but it feels less prominent that way :P

**El Capitano** (Light Blue Radiant Mask, Light Blue Trousers of the Wild) - for when the only weapon you need against Calamity Ganon is a flying elbow.

**Researcher/Scientist** (Thunder Helm OR Brown Flamebreaker's Helm, White Hylian Tunic, Navy Blue Flamebreaker Boots) - for when you need to study animal patterns, collect samples or fill out the Compendium.

**Classic (Updated)** - (Green Cap of the Wild, Green Hylian Tunic, Standard Hylian Trousers) - for an updated, adult version of the classic look.

**Punk** - (Standard Climber's Bandana, Standard Climbing Gear, White Hylian Trousers) - maybe not the most creative outfit but one I loved wearing; the colors work wonderfully and if you're going to equip a mop or go snowboarding/sand surfing, this is the outfit to do it with.

c7swatr,"&gt;I'm sincerely hoping that the answer is Miata

So get a Miata. They are fantastic cars, the cheapest and easiest way to attain the ""pure"" driving experience. Front engine, RWD, manual trans, 90 million miles of headroom, a light flywheel (gives the motor a snappy feeling) and great feeling clutch/shifter. They are also dirt cheap, easy to repair, cheap to modify, and cheap to insure. How far away from home do you think you'll move for school? Is there anyway you could borrow a car or not use the car when it snows? 

&gt;Reliability is also key; I won't have a ton of money, as I'm going to be putting a lot away for college.

&gt;I'm buying used to avoid payments

I like you. Ok, suggestion time: 

**93-98 BMW 325i or 328i-** This is probably the worst suggestion I can give you. They certainly aren't the most reliable cars, nor do they have the cheapest parts, and the interior is probably the worst quality BMW has ever sold. Its also RWD, which isn't great for your climate.

So why am I suggesting it? Its probably one of the best ""driver's cars"" you could buy. Also, despite being German, they are actually quite easy to repair. Mine taught me almost everything I know about working on cars. There is a pretty wide availability of parts at various price points, and an enormous aftermarket community. If you think you might be interested, come hang out in the E36 section of bimmerfest.com for a while and get an idea of what it would be like. You could buy a clean, well-maintained car for $3-4k, you'll just want to take it to a shop and get a PPI (pre-purchase inspection) done, which will give you a rap sheet of all the stuff the car is going to need in the near future so you can plan for it. 

As far as the RWD, a set of cheap wheels and good snow tires will get you places an AWD car on all-seasons never would.

**Some Sort of Subaru** You'll have to forgive me, I'm not a Subie Guru, but since you live in a cold climate with lots of snow this could be a great option. I'd imagine the early 2000's Imprezas (non-WRX) would be close to your price range. Fairly reliable cars, but anything you buy is going to need some sort of repair at some point, its inevitable. Because its a non-turbo 4-cylinder its going to be extremely slow. Slower than the E36 by a decent margin and not as fun to drive in the dry. However, if you're in a very cold climate that has snow on the ground most of the time, an AWD car like the impreza would be an absolute blast despite its slowness

**Integra/Civic Hatch-** Cheap, reliable, the Integra is touted as the ""best handling FWD chassis"" and they are easy to work on. Great option if that's what you're into.

**Mazda Protege** Neat little cars available in a sedan or little hatch/wagon thing. Mazda's are generally considered the ""driver's alternative"" to the appliance-like Toyotas and Hondas. Cheap and reliable, but they are prone to early rust, might be an issue in your climate.

","Thanks for the suggestions! My parents have put a foot down on a no Germans policy, due to the part expensiveness, as they know I've no experience with wrenches and grease (I learned how to change the oil, at least!) and would have to buy the parts and do the big stuff at dealers/shops.

Story: I was on tinder looking for women I could potentially date. Wasn't going well, we'd be a match I'd say hello and introduce myself etc. And they wouldn't reply, and I'm not talking they wouldn't reply right away, I mean just never. This one girl I did meet was cool we talked hung out twice, had some fun. Cool okay over here she just stopped talking I didn't do anything, she just travels alot. After that and the getting ignored matches, I kicked the kindling and forgot Tinder. Sometimes I go one when bored at work. Now I found OkCupid, set up my profile and made it as best I could, started getting many likes in a couple hours from women that had profiles that look like it took alot of effort. I'd assume someone wanting to catfish wouldn't take the time to do all that and fill all the questions out. I've talked to many of them on the app. Then this beautiful Indian women likes my profile, I had liked hers a day before she did mine and so I messaged her with a cute nice messsge. We started talking on the 29th of July. Finally she tell me add her on Instagram, so I do. Of course I ask her name and what she does for a living, works as a nurse in the baby and delivery dept of a hospital Kaiser in Sac, my friend just so happens to work for the same hospital but at a different location in the same city. I ask him do you think she could be a cstfish he said no. Thats pretty specific to name the hospital instead of just saying Oh I work in sac at kasier. I find her on Facebook, there's current posts but her profile on Facebook being somewhat private I only see a little bit of her posts on the 25-27. We keep talking (texting) and I mention she should get a snapchat. (Can't really fake a photo on there right? I mean it's real time pics. If you upload a pic it goes into the chat area.) So she gets a snapchat I send one she sends one. Cool she's real. I keep talking about taking her out she says she'd like to sometime. (Just need to find a time) she sent me a snapchat on the 30th wearing a flower shirt outfit and then another on the 31st I believe with the same outfit and today I got one from her a bit ago and again samething, it was angled down shot from above kind in a selfie and i could see cleavage and her bra. And i just casually said i like it, same shirt. She replied wearing it to go swimming. Forgot to add above on the first day we started talking I sent her a pic and I just mentioned never done online dating and heard of catfishing and so she said I'm a real person and all that and then sent me a pic of her in PJ'S.  

I tried searching for her on a Nurse registry, but her last time is Singh (which is the only last name on her facebook). I know that's an Indian tradition for females.

Either I'm being paranoid and over thinking this. But isn't not hard to find a huge album full of pictures of the same girl and use them. 

I'm gonna ask her to go on a date tonight possibly. 

Is there anything else I could do to figure this out before I meet her and find out its not who she says she is?

cb1520s,"For some reference, I'm a prominent member of the IBTC. I have a handful or so to work with, and it's a huge insecurity for me. I am never ever happy with my boobs, can't stand to have them exposed most of the time, and just generally kind of obsess over wishing they were bigger. I feel like less of a woman/less sexual a lot of the time because of it, which feels silly, but I can't help feeling like that.

Except...during sex when I'm on top, my (male) SO will lean forward and latch on to one of my nipples. And oh my god. It feels AMAZING. It's not sexual in the same way that touching my clit/vagina is, but it's strongly arousing and it's almost...empowering? and fills me with this huge rush of feeling like I'm taking care of him somehow. I've never had a child or been pregnant, so I have no idea where that feeling comes from. But it's such a great feeling, on par with an orgasm. I want it all the time. Not just during sex. When we're just spending time together, I wish he could be sucking on my tits.

The problem is...I don't know why I feel like this. Is it normal? To guys, how would you feel about your girlfriend/whoever wanting casual nipple ...? sucking, I guess. I don't want to call it a nursing kink because I feel like that has somewhat icky connotations, like associating him with a child. Which is really the opposite of our relationship completely, he's very dominant and I like it. But I digress. Do a lot of other women feel like this?

Especially because I don't even like for him to touch my boobs most of the time because of how insecure I am about their size. And yet I want them to be sucked on all the time?... I'm so confused about my own feelings! I'm sorry for ranting, I guess I'm just worried about how normal this all is. Thanks to anyone who made it through.

I've been dating this really fit, athletic man for two months now and it has been going really, really well. I am so happy! :D

I told him pretty early, like on the third date, that I am working on losing weight and he was super interested in how I track my calorie and my daily steps. We even spontaneously exercised together and we have plans on going to the gym together. Generally our dates are also pretty active because we usually take pretty long walks, which is my favourite thing.

Since then I have lost another fair chunk of weight and now it's starting to get really obvious that I lost weight. My double-chin is gone, my fat rolls are getting smaller and smoothing out, my legs are more fit, my blouses are more loose, etc. etc. Recently I even posted about how I can finally wear skirts now and it looks absolutely amazing!

So last night, after a long walk and a nice day in the park, my new boyfriend and I were busy taking each other's clothes off. In the middle of whatever we were doing, he just stopped while I was standing naked in front of him. He just looked at my body from top to bottom, touched it and said: ""You are so beautiful. And you will continue to get even more beautiful as you work on yourself."" The look in his eyes was also full of admiration. He really meant what he just said. About a week ago he told me that every time he sees me, I have become a little more beautiful because my face and shape are constantly changing and improving.

It felt so amazing. In the past I might have felt nervous about being directly looked at or I wouldn't have really believed the words. But in that moment and combined with the experiences of the past few weeks and all the amazing progress I've made...I realized that he is right. He is absolutely correct. I will continue to work on myself. I got this. I am disciplined and ambitious and more active. My goals are all absolutely attainable. My life is in a great place, summer is here and I am going to enjoy myself and use the sunshine to work on my goals and dreams! Awesome!","Hot damn, that's awesome.

d8rbd03,"Hola, 

Hopefully this post is okay. Mods please let me know if it isn't. 

I've come to Antigua, Gautemala from Australia via USA, Mexico and Belize just over a month ago. Originally, when I left Australia, I planned to go straight to Canada as I have a working holiday visa. Since I have until July 2017 to start the visa, I wasn't in a rush to get there and my sister (who, im a past life, had been a travel agent for many years) suggested I come to Central America and do a tour from Playa del Carmen, México to Antigua, Gautamala. 

About me. Im 30 years of age and was diagnosed with ADHD in April of this year. Since then I have been prescribed 25 mg of dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) each day in the form of 5 x 5 mg (short release) tablets. The impact on my life has been profoundly positive. In fact there is no way I would have considered leaving Australia, let alone coming to central America before taking them. I simply wouldn't have been able to cope. 

Before leaving Australia I obtained letters from both my GP and the psychiatrist who originally diagnosed me with ADHD and has written all my prescriptions, including the ones I have woth me right now. The letters explain the entirety of my history with both doctors (including non adhd stuff) as well as my current prescription.

With me I have the original container the medication comes in, which has a sticker detailing my prescription, who it belongs to etc. As of yesterday I realised I only have 16 days worth. 

I jave been here in Antigua for two weeks taking Spanish lessons and was planning on travelling down into El Salvador and onward to Panama next Monday (in 4 days) with a friend I met on the tour here. The trip will take 6 weeks and I really want to go. 

I researched the legality and available before coming on this trip (i.e. I Googled it) and believed that it was available here. Apparently that is very much not the case. 

Two days ago I went to a local doctor and showed him the letters, my current bottle with prescription affixed, and my passport to prove who I am. 

He called around to various pharmacy's see if dexamphetamine was available and he was told no, there is no dexamphetamine anywhere in Gautemala. 

The doctor was told that ritalin is available here, however it is tightly controlled. He wrote me a script and told me that I'd have to go to a laboratory in Guatemala city to get it, and even then I believe it will take 20 days for the script to be filled. Moreover, I'm not sure I want to switch medications. The prescription is for 20 tablets at 5 mg. I've never taken ritalin, so im not 100% on the appropriate dosage level, but from what I've read online the starting dose for ritalin is 10 mg, 3 times a day, so 20 tablets will last me just over three days. Not knowing the appropriate dosage is another reason I'm hesitant to switch. The doctor I went to here is the family doctor of the family I'm staying with and seemed like an ethical guy. 

Before I came to Central America, I stayed with my brother in Seattle. Because I didn't want to risk losing all my medication should my luggage go astray, and that taking so many pills with me for such a short trip might appear suspicious, and also because I didn't think I'd be here for this long, I left a bottle with 100 pills at his place. A few people have suggested getting him to post it, but that seems hugely illegal, which the Australian Consulate confirmed (medication can only be brought into the country if you have it with you). 

If I can't work out how to refill my prescription before I run out, I'll have to fly back to Seattle, but I really want to avoid having to do that if I can. 

If anyone has any suggestions, or has experienced a similar situation, please give me any advice or guidance you have. 
Much appreciated. 

Christmas.

Edit 1:
A friend of mine back in Australia called the Guatemala consulate in Canberra and was told that it is possible to post prescription medication to Guatemala, however they weren't sure how USA and Mexico would feel about it. They also said it must be a delivered via courier service addressed, be addressed to me, have my prescription included, with a copy translated into Español, the contents need to be declared, and the courier needs to know what's in the package.

Unfortunately its after hours in USA so I'll have to wait until tomorrow to call and ask. ","I'm medicated with Dex as well. I was initially prescribed Ritalin and it didn't help; it was a horrible experience. Just thought you should know that not everyone responds positively to both medications, it depends on your individual brain chemistry. ",,,

d95oias,"Until today, I thought that I had lost a year of my life somewhere...

According to my birth certificate, school records, etc., I was born in October 1984. According to the scholastic guidelines, anyone born after September 30th 1984 would have missed the cut off to begin kindergarten in September 1989.

...however, I have an extremely sharp memory. I can remember people that I've only met once, trivial details of brief conversations that I've had with people. The one thing that my memory attaches to are repeating patterns, especially vocal cadences. For example: theme songs to popular TV shows or the way people will greet other people.

I can DISTINCTLY remember learning the calendar the first week of school. My teacher taught us the month (August), the day (30th) and the cadence of the year ""Nine-Teen-Eighty-Nine."" This sticks out in my head so well because of the first time we had to recite the date in January when we came back from holiday break, ""Nine-Teen-Ninety."" It stuck out in my head because it didn't flow is well, it wasn't as graceful.

Nineteen Ninety was the year I thought my father had passed away (according to his death certificate, it was 1991), it was the year between kindergarten and first grade, it did feel like an excruciatingly long summer and year, but I never gave it thought because I was grieving for my father.

As I look back on kindergarten pictures, it has the date on the school picture (taken in the fall) as 1990. I graduated high school in 2003, just like everyone else in that kindergarten picture. The 1989 date doesn't conflict with anyone else, everyone I went to high school with doesn't question that we started kindergarten in 1990.

HOWEVER, there was one girl who also picked up on the 1989 date. During some BS conversation during a study hall, kindergarten comes up and she says ""We started kindergarten in 1989, didn't we?"" A friend of hers did the math and she didn't say anything else about it. I didn't speak up because I was different enough as it was.

Up until today, I thought I had lost a year of my life somewhere. Perhaps I want to believe in the Mandela effect or something like it, but it sure answers a lot of questions.","Wow this is an interesting story.
The only explanation that pops into my head is that you were in the first year of kindergarten twice, like when people fail a grade but why would that happen? It's very unlikely.",,,

ddnyevb,"I made it ten-ish months! Annnnd, then toward the end of December, I started pretty much right where I left off.... and drank steadily until a week ago today. I hated every second of it, even if I let myself believe I was happier- after all, I truly did feel like the depression of the previous 10 months had been suddenly lifted. 

You see, even though I hadn't been drinking, and hadn't felt guilt or been sleepless or made a fool of myself or worried my children and friends, all was not right with me. I spent a vast majority of those sober ten months on my couch miserable and isolated and eating the hell out of everything, especially sugar. Gained a right good amount of weight to justify being even more miserable, and so on and so on and so on.

Food was my first addiction. It was the way my parents soothed me, and it became the way I soothed myself. So, exit alcohol, enter the original numbing tool.

A week ago I woke up guilty  about something. I didn't even know what, as usual, and sometimes there really isn't anything more to be guilty about than I drank myself to brown out and passed out. This time, that was not the case. I had embarrassed myself and made a dear friend feel like absolute shit for no reason (on Facebook of course).... I was mortified. I spent a day cocooned in the guilt and angst and anxiety only true alcoholics understand.

It only took me about a month to get back to that? Imagine if I went another 20 years like my first stint? 

I could write forever. It's cathartic and it helps me sort out my thoughts. But, I'm going to go journal instead- I'll spare you my goal-setting and lengthy pontifications on weensworld's world ;)

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A lot of them just smiled at me when we made eye contact and I would smile back and that's it.

After a couple weeks on nofap I definitely noticed the superpowers. Girls I had never looked at before were looking at me and smiling. I was chatting up every girl I could at every chance. It was really amazing. I've talked to more women in those few weeks than I have in the last few years. My energy was unlimited. Never felt tired and even had trouble falling asleep but never woke up miserable and exhausted like before. 

At about 22 days I hit flatline. My dick was completely dead and I felt very depressed. I didn't make any effort to talk to people very much anymore. Felt no motivation whatsoever and even left work early a few times cause fuck it I didn't want to be there.

About 10 days later I just had the most horrible urges of my life to beat off. Non stop boners everywhere I went and all night even at the gym I'd have terrible boners. All I could ever think about was blowing my load. But was still very depressed.

Anyway after 41 days I finally gave in and beat off over the toilet in the bathroom and had the biggest load of my life lol. I don't know how to feel about it. It's the day after and I suppose I just kind of feel ""meh"" about it. I still feel very depressed and my dick feels dead again. I don't know if I want to try nofap again or if I should just do noporn. I know porn is very damaging to the mind but I felt I was suffering on nofap after a month and wasn't getting the positive effects anymore.

Just my thoughts and rambling first post... good luck everyone",You shouldn't have given in. Have some self-control. You were almost to 50 days bro,,,
c7b70jx,"Hey I was thinking of bringing a Grind house night to the Charles Theater, a double feature with the first being a classic grind movie such as Ilsa! She-Wolf of the SS followed by a B movie similar to what you would see on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Is there any one here who would support that with maybe going or helping with advertising or what groups I could talk to to get a lot of support?
**update** so I got in touch with the company that made black devil doll and they charge 60% of the box office if the theater charges 375 as sophiabegonia suggested then I would need to sell 187 5 dollar tickets just to break even.

2002 Ford Ranger Edge here.  Past few months I have had a little coolant leak that I have had to keep putting antifreeze in... I notice a little soda can size spot under my vehicle after it has been driven for awhile.  I would say I am adding about a jug of antifreeze once a month.. I replaced the water pump, but that has not solved the issue- I am now thinking it must be a small leak in the radiator?

As mentioned in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10wh66/faq_you_buddy/) about the FAQs, we will be posting a question every few days and asking you guys to give us your answer for it. The best answers will be used in the actual FAQ.

**Today's question is: ""Honestly now: Does penis size matter?""**

Some ideas for how to answer include the more specific questions of ""Would you turn down a guy who had a small penis on a one-night-stand?"", ""How big is too big?"", ""Do any of you have troubles having sex with a small/large penis?"", ""Can a small penis be satisfying?"", ""Would you reconsider a relationship with a guy due to his penis size?"" etc.

Also, **these posts will be heavily moderated** which means there will be zero tolerance for anyone breaking the subreddit's rules (see the sidebar/info button for reference) and that any derailment from the topic question will be removed. Discussing the topic is totally fine, but keep it clean and friendly and female-focussed, folks!

d9r41u7,"I hope that I won't get shot down for posting my thoughts here, but I'll give this a go. I just need get it off my chest.

Let me start off by saying that I always thought that I would marry a girl and have kids and all the traditional stuff, despite being also interested in men. Although that was a different kind of interest, not even in my wildest dream I ever thought about dating a man. Until I met him.

I am from the United Kingdom myself and I was living in Sydney for about 1,5 years because of work. We met each other about 4 months before I was scheduled to go back home. And we fell for each other instantly (although we never really acted on these feelings). To be perfectly honest, I've never felt that kind of connection with anyone. Not my best friends, no my lovers, no my parents. It was very odd but we hit it off literally the minute we saw each other. I told him since the very beginning that I will leave in a couple of months and he was fine with it. We were just hanging out and having good time. Like great friends who also kiss. We never talked about having a relationship because it was always off the table with me leaving so soon.

We honestly had the time of our while we were together for these few months and I couldn't be any happier about our time spent together. But we were both very realistic about our relationship and we knew that most likely this will end the day when I have to leave because very few relationships can withstand a distance of more than 10,000 miles and 10-hour time difference. We agreed to continue if we ever meet again. I have 3 more years left to work in the UK before I could move to Sydney. It was difficult for me to leave but we said our goodbyes and off I went.

Four week later I received a text message from him saying how much he misses me. Little did he know that these past 4 weeks were arguably one of the hardest time in my entire life. I really tried to forget him but couldn't. I thought to myself: *Okay, even if he forgets me and moves on. I will find him one day and give it another shot.* 

It's been about 2 months since he broke the silence with that text message and we've been in touch regularly ever since. Eventually we admitted to each that we have very strong feelings towards each other and that we would like to be in a relationship. 

That's when he said the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. He's not only planning to visit me in a few months but he also wants to move across the world to the UK until we can move back to Sydney  together (I want to move there regardless). 

I cannot believe how much my life has changed in such a short period of time. It's very scare time as everything is so new and unknown in this ""I'm dating a guy now"" world, but I'm so happy and I think I might have found something very special here. He seems like the most humble, selfless and caring person in the world. I can't think of anyone in the world who I care about more. I know it probably sounds crazy to be with someone who lives so far away, but life is so damn short not to date the right people. Otherwise I know that I would regret this decision until the day I die.

And if you have someone who you want to be with but you think you can't - go and tell them that right now! Work on it together! You won't live forever and things like distance, finances and other factors can be worked on -  as long as both of you are willing to do so!

Peace, Love, and Great Day to Everyone!

dnrlu7z,"&gt;I asked if he had realized that's what I was trying to do. He said he knew, but didn't really consider it trying, since I didn't use my mouth--neither gave him a bj nor verbally asked for sex. 

He realized so he knew it was trying. But it was not offering him what he wanted and he is selfish.

&gt;He also said he's not sure we should have sex again until after his vasectomy. Fair enough, except he hasn't even scheduled the consult yet. 

Well that is pretty clear isn't it?

&gt;I told him there are other things we can both do for each other if PIV is off the table. He said that I never spontaneously offer him bj's or hj's, so it's unreasonable of me to expect manual stimulation (oral for me is off the table) without directly asking for it. 

I'm sorry, what? He does not offer, right? He expect you to offer, right? Oh, that's right, he is showing that he is selfish.

&gt;I can't directly ask for it.

cus42pb,"I'd like to add to what P. said.
Firstly, well done for getting up there and reading. You faced your problem head on. Proud of you.
Now, remember all the successes and compare them to this single outlier. Find some beads and count out two piles; one pile for not turning red for the past 6 months; another pile for turning red. I'm sure your not-red pile is bigger. 

It is a flaw of human nature that the fear of failure is more intense than the joy of success and those of us who struggle with anxiety have it even worse. Please know that you are improving and the general trend is less blushing and more time between them. Concentrate on your successes and treat yourself. Have you treated yourself for all your achievements so far? Probably not, we tend not to. So, remember those clearly, vividly and spend as much time remembering those good moments as you can. The time you spend in those good memories displaces the fearful thoughts. It's tricky but after a while it becomes easier. 

If none of that is doable then imagine a loved one in the same situation. Would you scare them half-to-death about it by re-living it or would you be compassionate and understanding? Then remember that the other person is you and be compassionate to yourself. Be patient with yourself, you are getting better but every now and again you'll have a blip. Those blips may cluster sometimes but the general trend is of improvement.

You are doing great. Keep strong and keep going.

She's religious, but I found out a few years later that she wasn't a virgin when she married. She was still serious about it, however. She even had my older brother (by six years) come in the room when she was talking to me once and tell me he doesn't respect women who aren't virgins. This is on top of my dad calling women sluts and whores for just kissing on television shows (never men).

I've been asked out five times in the past year and have said no to all of them. Even when enjoying a conversation with them, I freeze up when they ask me out. One because I don't want to take anyone home to my family, and two because I know they would eventually want to have sex with me (and I know logically the relationship won't last at this age). 

I don't feel this way about anyone else--like the idea of having sex with someone experienced doesn't turn me off, and I don't see women like my family sees them when they have had multiple partners. I've even talked with a friend about sex a lot because she's getting close to that point with her boyfriend. What I'm really worried about is that if I'm not a virgin the boy I'm with will think I'm used goods and could never fully love me (or I could never fully love him because I'm not experiencing everything with him for the first time).

I've been seeing a therapist since I was 15, and because of that I'm afraid to talk to him about this. One because I started seeing him when I legally could not have sex, and two because he's a young man (and I'm not attracted to him, he's like a fatherly figure and that thought disgusts me).

I'm sorry this became so long. I'd really appreciate perspective from both men and women

Edit: Oh wow. I'm going to school and then I'll read all the responses. Thank you everyone for replying !

Edit 2: I'm still reading a lot of these. I don't know what to say, there is just so much support. I still have some negative perceptions about virginity which I'll talk to my therapist about when I see him next, but for now I'm focusing on invalidating those negative thoughts whenever they come up.","a hymen has no value, but your family's input on sex / virginity is worthy of being laughed at. you will lose no value. you'll gain experience and maybe have a good time. Sounds like you'll have to keep it outside of the parents house. Cars, the woods, abandoned areas are all fun.

cy0m2ew,"Okay , so the thing I'm going to write isn't exactly scary but it has been clouding up my mind with tons of questions . Maybe you guys can answer my questions .

 About an year ago , it was that typical stormy night and it was thundering badly . Me being kinda scared of this type of weather decided to sleep with my mum . My mom and dad are separated so yeah we live alone with a dog . I was really exhausted because of the amount of homework i had completed . 

I had a dream , not only a dream but many dreams. One was ( what i remember ) me and my cousin in London's Railway Station , then i was in a train , my classmates were in that train too , Suddenly the colour of their pupils changed to red and they were all staring at me and my vision started becoming blurry , suddenly i was out of the train . It was dark outside and there was a rice field filled with water on the left and on the right was a graveyard ( not the normal ones , i don't know how to describe it  ..) And the train was parked there . 
The dream changed to me sleeping in my room with the same stormy weather . An evil dark figure ( looking like a witch ) blasted through the big window of my room and threw something type of dust or i don't know what one me when i suddenly woke up . I was sweating badly , it felt so real . I was even confused if it was dream . 

The next morning when in shower i felt something under my hands on my lower back . I ignored it . After a week or something i really payed attention it and showed it to my mom . There were marks of hands on my back . It was like someone had been holding me tightly from the front , fingertips were towards the spine side .  . And there was another one just under my shoulder on the back .The fingers were sleek , slim and were slightly clawy on the tips. It was and is impossible for me to create those marks because of the angles . 
I'm 15 and my family doesn't allows that so marks because of OTHER THINGS ( you know what i mean ) is impossible . 

It has been an year now and those marks are still there . Press Your three fingers on your hand tightly . The marks with red tracings on the border and white skin in middle  which form for seconds are the exact marks on my back but for an year without fading away a single percent .    

I don't have any idea what it was about . It wasn't there before . After that I've been having dreams , bad dreams . Like just 3-4 days back i had a dream of being stabbed below my stomach  and then i woke up with a severe pain on that part , when i checked what is it there was a mark , but it was a birthmark . A birthmark in the shape like it was really stabbed .  My mum always scolds me that its my fault , fault of watching horror stuff . But i don't if it really was my fault . I wonder if any of you have this type of experience .   ",Try salt around the window ledges and a piece of iron by your bed. A dream catcher might help as well. ,,,

dq814hw,"&gt;Because of a lack of obedience   
   
I don't really think this is the reason. I think that the lack of repercussions is the underlying reason. You said that you wished the guy doing the illegal u-turn, inconveniencing you and others, would have been stopped by the police. The fact is, though, he did it because he, like everybody else, has totally internalized this idea that the police never will stop them or do anything. Once tickets start getting handed out and rules get enforced, things will change. As long as the rules are not enforced (or are only selectively enforced), that's just the way it'll be.   
   
You'll eventually get more comfortable with some of these things, but it still won't be perfect. I especially hated the traffic situation, just like you, when i first arrived. It took me maybe 3 months to not get pissed off every time I cross an intersection. I've steadily developed this zen-like *don't-give-a-fuck* thing...unless somebody takes it too far (e.g. turn on red and speeds into us at the intersection only to stop inches from us).
   
I struggled a lot with making Chinese friends, too. And I'm not even Chinese. At least it's nice that it's so easy to make western friends here from all over the world (or japanese friends, korean friends, etc.). The Chinese friends that you do make will tend to be ones with similar interests to yours or similar experiences. It takes time, but it's great when it happens. Maybe the shared interest is alcohol. That's a popular one for many of us expats. ","Hit the nail on the head with your argument about a lack of repercussions.  It's not only a lack of law enforcement but also social enforcement. Like another user said above, if nobody calls out bad behavior, it will keep occurring. I think it's happening more these days but there is still too much respect for the elderly and a fear of confrontation.  ",,,

After lurking around this subreddit for awhile i've finally decided that I want to give DE a try. I have no experience with DE whatsoever so I'm following advice from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/2rekl3/trying_to_find_my_boyfriend_and_awesome_gift_but/cnf6gnd) which our very own /u/Leisureguy had some excellent input (as one would expect) and also [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/3995ec/set_up_for_a_beginner/) which /u/Nostradamus1 introduces the Maggard kit.

I whipped together a kit from Maggard as seen [HERE](http://imgur.com/gallery/wtf0igc/new). From what i've read, this seems like a pretty solid beginners kit but I was hoping to get some additional advice and/or suggestions about anything at all, whether it be things I should swap out in this kit, add to, remove from, or if I should maybe build a kit individually from various sites. I've read lots of good things about the Parker 24C/26C and the Maggard M series seems decent also. 

Since I have no experience with DE, I don't know what razors are going to work best for me so I was thinking of placing an order of the Top 10 Sampler from [Tryablade](http://tryablade.com/samplers).

cukwwgc,"You might be a good candidate to try a partial Soylent diet. Just my own personal experience, but even as a fitness profesional myself, substituting 1000 calories of my diet during weekdays with Soylent really helped me to kick my cravings because it's just so damned awesome at appetite control. It's bland (but not offensive) tasting, so it doesn't reinforce any sweet/salty/crunchy food cravings, has a good carb balance, and a ton of healthy fats per serving, so it does a fantastic job at managing blood sugar levels for hours after eating it. I drink whey along with it to boost the protein content, and even now as I have reduced my Soylent intake to make room for more protein, it's still my go-to when I otherwise would run into portion control problems for my next meal.  When trying to cut or recomp, most of the advice people give doesn't take into account the enormous effect your blood sugar levels have on keeping your appetite and energy levels in check.

dr8r72a,"WILLIAMS TWP., Pa. - An autopsy determined the human remains found in a Williams Township home last Thursday night were that of a woman who'd been missing for three years.

With the assistance of Pennsylvania State Police, finger prints were obtained from the body and the coroner says Jamie Metzger, last seen in April 2014, was the victim.

She was 38 at the time she went missing. The cause and manner of the death are pending.

UPDATE:

Hey Reddit, I am not dead...not yet, at least. I knocked out after I posted that last night and since it had been spam filtered for a while, I assumed I wasn't going to get any replies so I never followed up on it. 

Alright so I'm about to head over to the ER right now. I'm not feeling too well.
The reason I was hesitant to go last night was because it was 3:00am and I had just gotten home from college. I didn't want to wake my parents up and freak them out for no apparent reason, but clearly there very well is a legitimate reason.

Yes, I agree that I was a drunken idiot. Yes, I recognize that I'm still an idiot for having waited 15 hours to go to the ER.

Description of problem
==================

While playing a game my PC will occasionally freeze up and the only solution is to hold the power button for ten seconds. Ctrl+Alt+Del and Alt+Tab don't save me. By freeze up, I mean everything stops working. The monitor freezes and if I unplug the monitor or power cycle it it goes black. The audio devices stop working, the mouse and keyboard stop working. This will usually happen out of the blue with no precursor or warning, but occasionally it will freeze up and then unfreeze a few times before finally freezing for good. 

On one occasion after the freeze I left it for a few minutes and it blue screened, giving me stop code: CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT. On another occasion after the first bluescreen it bluescreened again giving me the stop code: DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION. It has only bluescreened twice so I am unsure if those are unrelated problems. 


When this issue began
==================
Has happened in the past but stopped for a while with no explanation. Is now happening again as of last week.

Recurring issue
==================
Yes

Date of purchase
==================
N/A

Under Warranty
==================
Yes

Cause/Steps to recreate the issue
==================

Play a video game for a few hours. It happens most commonly with Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. It has happened with other games though. Just today it happened in Cities: Skylines and a few other examples that it has happened in are Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Just Cause 3.

What I've tried so far to resolve the issue
==================

* Restore BIOS to Optimized Defaults
* Reset CMOS
* Update BIOS to latest version
* Set CPU and GPU to stock voltages and frequency
* Uninstalled low level programs such as Gigabyte Easy Tune and Gigabyte System Information Viewer
* Ran Prime95 for 20 minutes with CPU stock (no crash)
* Ran Furmark for 20 minutes with GPU stock (no crash)
* Set CPU VCore Loadline Calibration to High from Auto
* Checked temperatures, both CPU Package and GPU never pass 70C and most commonly sit between 40C-60C
* Checked voltages of all the PSU rails and the CPU VCore after load and after a crash, all are fine

d9pzxmf,"These two favorites of mine arrived in the mail last week. The Blind Melon album is a remastered version of their self titled debut. Along with their first studio recording 'Sippin Time Sessions' on side 4 of the 180 gram 2LP edition. The 4th side consists of early versions of the songs; Dear Ol' Dad, Soul One, Tones of Home, Seed to a Tree, and Mother. Fantastic pressing and a must have for Blind Melon fans. 

The other album is Traveling Without Moving by Jamiroquai. Originally released in 1996, this is the groups third studio album. This particular release is the remastered 180g MOV version. It's a gatefold 2LP edition. This album features the smash hits, Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl. My favorite track is Drifting Along. The album delves into sounds reminiscent of 70's soul, acid jazz, and hints of reggae. ","I love Drifting Along!

As long as you work up to the training volume you can still lift with decent intensity and frequency while rowing ","I should have mentioned that this is more of a routine for rowers to form a solid strength base. I certainly don't dislike cleans and snatches, but I think they should be done when the rower has become strong enough. No need for people who can't squat 225 yet to mess with cleans and snatches.

c5prhwc,"Lived in Pavilion for 2 years, so I can tell you a few things:

Convenience:
You don't have to worry about parking because the school is only a 3 minute walk away. Also, busses stop along W. Call st so if you're lucky you can catch a bus to class. Some fast food restaurants are within walking distance and so is Coliseum. 

Management:
In my experience, management and the people at the office are helpful and generally friendly. I had some issues that needed to be solved at the office and they handled it well. Maintenance guys look sketchy, but if you have a sink that needs fixing, they are usually prompt. Again, this is just my experience. Pavilion also has frequent ""emergency water shut off"" the lasts about 4 hours, but it's usually during the time people are in school (10am-1pm). 

Apartment:
Dingy for what you paid. Walls are thin, furnished beds may be old and dirty, cheap looking desks and dim lights. I think in terms of apartment quality, there are places just as good as the Pavilion for less. Also, not having a washer/dryer in the unit sucks, especially when other residents leave their clothes for days. With parking, you should get the pricy decal as there are very limited visitor's parking. Plus if you park in the visitor's parking- visitor or otherwise- on a game day, you will get towed. Pets are not allowed, like most student homes, but I know plenty of people with dogs/ cats there. I hear if you get caught, there will be a fine. 

Break-ins, parties, etc:
I've never experienced someone breaking into my unit, but plenty of other neighbors have. Just make sure to lock all windows and doors at night, and double check before leaving for winter/ spring break. Even if your room is on the 2nd/3rd floor, break-ins are likely to happen. 
Anywhere you live, there will be noisy neighbors, and Pavilion is not an exception. For 2 years I had neighbors that partied at least twice a week, so if you're a light sleeper, having earplugs might be good. 

Overall it's slightly below average. I chose Pavilion for its closeness to campus and decent price. 
But most importantly, make sure you get along with your roommates. Make in-house rules, know who is taking out the trash, and learn how to compromise. Having great roommates at a shitty apartment is way better than having shitty roommates at a great apartment.

I know a lot of you struggle with low AMH and DOR so I feel a little weird putting this out there. But we're all here for one reason or another.

My AMH was 9.3. The nurse said they want it over 1 so ""9 is great""

I searched the boards for this and did some googling. Apparently over 5 can be linked to pcos? Does anyone here have a higher AMH and does *not* have pcos?

I have longer but usually regular cycles of about 35 days. I'm on the low side of the bmi scale. I probably tweeze more than I want but who doesn't right? 

Thanks in advance.","My AMH count is 6.69. I'm 33, my cycles are between 28 and 33 days, and no other PCOS symptoms beyond some suspicious body hair. 

My doctor said that my high AMH is a very positive sign as it indicates a high ovarian reserve and completely dismissed my PCOS concerns. 

Wish I could say I'm confident she's right - I still find myself having nagging doubts and wondering what questions I should ask to make sure PCOS isn't a factor. We'll be starting IVF soon (assuming our 3rd IUI doesn't work) and I wish I could rule PCOS out as another complicating factor. LE SIGH.

de0l2if,"This last week before the end of S3 has been one of the worst for me in terms of harassment. I talk in voice chat a lot and try to shotcall if no one else does because I feel as though a lot of people tunnel and as a healer I'm in the back and can see a lot more of the field. Let me share with you some of the things that have been said to me since I have been playing a bit more than usual since the announcement that S3 is ending.

The mundane:
""Can I get some nudes?"" ""Hey, why aren't you in the kitchen making me a sandwich?"" 

The explicit:
""Let me lick your gaping donut hole."" ""You're a small tittied bitch."" ""I bet you have a fat cunt.""

I usually queue with a guy friend, and if someone is being exceptionally nasty they'll continue with comments like ""Awe, little girl has to queue with her boyfriend."" or ""Can I get a turn at pounding that pussy, my man?

Has anyone else been harassed like this? If you have, what did you do?  I try so very, very hard not to respond to people that say this kind of shit, so much that I'll leave voice channel if it gets really bad. I always block and report them after the match, but sometimes I just stop queuing completely because I'm scared that I'll get matched up against them again and I'll have to endure more. If you haven't been subject to sexual harassment, have you ever been in a game where someone was being harassed? Did you try to stick up for them or report them?

I always report them, but a lot of the time it's over voice channel so I don't have proof that they said those things, just my friend to back me up. Should I start recording my matches so I have proof? If I encounter this again, I can't send video over the in-game report, who do you think I should contact? I just know how bad it sucks to be subjected to this, and I really wish I could put a stop to it so other people don't have to put up with it.

EDIT: For those who are asking I'm NA PC at 3300 (diamond).

EDIT2: For all those saying ""just mute"", sure that temporarily fixes it for me. I always mute, report, and block. But what about when one of their friends decides to tell me all the comments his friends are saying, and then I have to mute them too? What about all the other people that could potentially be harassed by that person? What about the younger kids in voice chat who listen to harassment and decide that since the older players are doing it they should too?

EDIT3: Even if this was a topic every few weeks, who cares? There are new people to the game and new people to the overwatch reddit who may never have seen this. After reading some of the comments, it seems like some people are genuinely surprised that things like this occur.","What the fuck. AUS servers never react like this to a girl on the team.

&gt;I'm finally graduating from high school and also graduating from community college with a 2 year degree this month.

Wait, full stop. That is amazing! How wonderful for you! Thats quite a feat, and I hope you have a chance to take a breath, step back, and say, ""Wow, I am all that and a bag of chips!"". I have a 18 year old and a almost 22 year old both boys, and the college thing is hard. That rocks!

&gt;I don't have many people to talk to it about, only my therapist who I only see once a week. I've only just been open about it to my closest friends/teachers.

Im so pleased that you have begun to open up with these things to outsiders you trust. The thing about abuse is it thrives in quiet, darkness and isolates you, as you have found. Getting it out there, talking about it, doing something about it, that takes moxie. It really does. I would guess you dont realize that right now because nothing is changed. Hes still an abusive jerk. But you cant change that. You can only control your reaction to that. Its a big deal. It really is. 

&gt;-Abuse makes me a flakey person 

Abuse doesnt make you flakey. It makes it near impossible to manage your emotions, to even identify them or process them. Its because you arent allowed to have authority or control over your own body and mind. You have to waste important energy to read and prepare to please him in order to avoid even nastier outcomes. Its why people that have been abused sometimes can be people pleasers. You arent flakey. You are being abused. This isnt who you really are or who you will be. 

&gt;abuse makes me socially withdraw even though I am an extrovert

Isolation is the goal for abuse. Abusers dont want other parents of your friends to find out whats going on and calling CPS. They dont want to be found out. They are cowards to their core. You are already in the process to get back to who you really are. You will be able to feel like yourself again once you are free. 

&gt;-abuse makes me mentally exhausted and distracted from daily tasks. 

You know, when I was your age I worked a retail job. On my feet standing. It was physically exhausting. I thought when I got an office job it would be so much easier, after all I would just be sitting at my desk all day. It turns out that mental energy messes you up in ways you never expect. Its real. Its draining. I remember one day I was driving back home from work and drove down the wrong street. Its not in your head. Its real. It will get better. 

&gt;He is only nice to me when he feels that I haven't been paying him any attention.

Yup. Its not about you, its all about him. You have figured some real stuff out. Just remember, all the things he says to you that are nasty, its usually because they are jealous. They cant tolerate you succeeding or getting attention from anyone. They need to tear you down. I hope someone has reported him to CPS for abusing your little Brother. I know this is hard. Im glad you have a therapist and have been talking to teachers. But you need to think about yourself and make you a priority. If your Mother wont leave him, and she doesnt prevent him from abusing you, she could be considered an enabler of that abuse. Im so sorry you are going through this, OP. You sound like one kickass young person. Keep up the good work!","This is the nicest thing that anyone has said to me❤️ so thoughtful. I thought I was the only one going through this :,( but after reading the posts and situations, I realize so many people are dealing with the same shit. Thank you so much for managing this.

d4q2uov,"I've always wanted to try an HGH cycle, I've tried it before in the past but with some cheap ass blue tops that probably were bunk.  So this time around I ponied up for the better Hygetropin.  First thing before the cycle I got some baseline labs done.  I'm a 32 year old 195lb guy.

[Baseline bloods](http://i.imgur.com/EIDuZT4.png)

Ordering from PurplePandaLabs was a breeze, shipping was a little delayed due to the dragonboat festival but after that was done things moved quickly.  I have to give a shout out how cleverly packed the HGH was.  If customs were to inspect, it still would've been fine.  These hygetropins were sourced from hygetropin.com.cn and had no security code.  The vials have the teal tops with the pinwheels.

I immediately started on 4iu/day last Monday (the 20th) and kinda started feeling the sides (tingling, definetely some water retention).  This past Friday I dosed a whole bottle (8ius) in the morning, and went back to labs and got my bloods drawn 3 hours 20 mins later (and I was fasting) and here are the results 

[After bloods](http://i.imgur.com/XGTOqwk.png)

Honestly I was a little disappointed, this is clearly real HGH but I thought the numbers would be a little higher...  I guess my question is, do I need to take more due to my weak baseline?

Issue: Intense arch pain in my right foot

Stop reading now unless you want super detailed info about my feet! :]

Context: Formerly a cross-country runner and now I run recreationally, just about 20 or so miles a week for fun. Mostly I run on trails, and sometimes on the street. I supenate/under-pronate when I run, I have medium/regular type arches, and the arch pain has been bothering me for about a year.

What I've tried: I've taken the issue to a doctor who referred me to a physical therapist. She was unable to diagnose the problem because she couldn't replicate the pain in the office (this really only bothers me while running). I've tried taking a break from running and easing back into it. I also added yoga into my routine to build in some stretching, and swimming, tennis, and skiing for cross-training. I've tried toe raises and a variety of calf stretches. I don't think the issue is plantar fasciitis since I've never felt any pain in my heel but can't be sure. Right now it feels like no matter what I try I keep getting this pesky pain about a mile into any run. 

Next Steps: In addition to going back to the doctor w/ a more aggressive list of questions, I'm thinking to try and stop wearing heels to work, which currently I do on occasion. Also thought I'd ask on this subreddit in case any of y'all have useful advice. 

","I'm sure other people can offer more help, but in the meantime I'll just say that I had a nagging arch pain during running that went away after a few weeks of consistently using a foam roller on my calf muscles. You didn't mention trying that so maybe it's worth a shot if you haven't? Good luck, hope you can find something to help soon.",,,

Part 2 is out: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/49l4h6/my_stepmother_part_2/

*****************

This might be a long post. I know we're not supposed to moan about story length but just a heads up! I've told the story many times before and as a result have seen it condense over many tellings. I'll try and return it to the full length as best as I can!

Another foreword is that this is still going on. It's just that many choices have been made since that have resulted in a much calmer atmosphere. She's still the crazy, delusional woman she always was though. I just have more distance from her.

So, the scene is the summer of 2010. I had just finished Primary School (for you non-Brits it's the place you leave when you're 10, before High School) and was ready to start the summer. Summers when you're 10 years or younger are typical, maybe a holiday (we weren't, and still aren't, the most well off family there is, so holidays were something to look forward to and enjoy as much as possible), some sleepovers, maybe a theme park visit. Apart from that, just waking up whenever, watching TV, anything.

I remember being the inquisitive kid I was I loved imagining. And being imaginative means you're sometimes a little nosy. I distinctly remember walking into my Dad's studio (he's a musician in a rock band) and seeing a ring on the table, and not thinking anything of it. I mentioned it to a friend, who was a little more concerned, saying my parents might split up. I was a little more on edge after that conversation, but the summer went ahead as normal. I remember finding a book in the kitchen titled ""ways to save your marriage"" or something like that. Again, I just thought my parents were working something out. My mum was in the conservatory, and I went over to talk to her. I remember the conversation like it was yesterday:


&gt; Me: Are you and Dad splitting up?

&gt; Mum: ...yes.


It's simple I know, but above all I remember the environment. I was looking out the window into our back garden, near the hut we kept the Guinea Pigs in. I remember turning to face my Mum when she said ""yes"" and just having this look of utter shock on my face. Being the overly-dramatic 10 year old I was, I threatened to ""run away into the valley"" (which is a huge forest / landscape behind our house) and stuff like that. I got some paper and pretended to write a book about how sad I was. I loved attention but was heartbroken at the same time - not a good mix. The worst part was that I was starting high school in around a few weeks time. You might think, ""that's OK, you'd have friends to help you through it"" - nope. I was moving to a new high school with only two people from my primary school going with me - two girls, who never really spoke with me or had any friendship. 

I felt utterly alone.
High School started September 2010. My Dad had already moved out and gone to live in a flat somewhere miles away. I can't remember exactly where it was. I remember crying all the time and having my mum comfort me. I wasn't, and still am not, one of the ""tough lads"" who plays footie and drinks etc. etc. I'm a musician and a programmer and as a result got a lot of shit over the years for expressing myself in music, a couple YouTube channels I had, and overall being a little reclusive. So, this didn't help with the situation at home. Whenever possible, I went over to see my Dad.


He had bought himself a flat. You walked into this small hallway, and his was on the left. There was another to the right, then a staircase that went upstairs to a few more places. I think it was around Saltaire as I remember going for walks around there somewhere around 2010-ish time. The apartment was nice on first glance - a fire, large window to look out onto the road, TV (which my Dad hooked his computer up to), then an upstairs with a bathroom and a bedroom (king-sized bed or something similar). It wasn't until I went to stay over a few times that the main issue kicked in. It was freezing. We dragged a heater next to us to play a board game once and still shivered constantly. Sleeping was better but still freezing cold. Above all was a constant feeling of something being ""off"" - you could never settle properly because you felt so uncomfortable.


One day the roof in the next apartment burst open and the people inside has moved out a few days earlier or something. My Dad wanted to leave after that. When he did move out, he learned that he was either the only person living there in the entire building or there was another person who was hardly ever there. We also had to venture down into the basement once because the power cut out and the landlord couldn't come over so told my Dad to do it. It was almost pitch black and led to the realization that there was a back door which was kept shut with a little chair leant against it. Anyone could have given the door a little nudge and they would have been straight in.


So, my Dad moved out. It turned out he'd been seeing someone else for months. Her name is Sue. So, Sue seems nice at first. My Dad (quite suddenly) moves in with her, and then all the shit starts.


I remember getting an email telling me that I ""had to come and see her"" or something to that extent. Basically, I didn't want to see her, but the condition set forward was that I had to see her in order to see my Dad. This left me distraught but I eventually gave in. They pulled up one night, with my stepbrother in the back seat - Matt. Matt was around 9 years old or something like that. He was the nicest kid ever, and that makes looking back on it all the more painful and, above all, angering.


Turns out Matt never saw his Dad. Sue barred him from seeing him and so he instantly took a liking to my Dad, and eventually called him Dad too. Their house was small, and a spare room had been thrown around into a small room for me. For months I'd see my Dad for a few hours, usually stay for the night, then go back the next day. I was fine with this! Seeing my Dad made up for the fact Sue was there too.


But something about Sue was - off. The same feeling from the flat Dad had. She was nice, but in a somewhat sinister way - she'd randomly offer to make me some food gone 10 o'clock at night; I'd start playing some music and she'd run in and turn the volume up and start jumping around all hyper. She'd sit with bottles of wine and just drink for hours - sometimes days - on end. She'd go without sleep. She'd sleep without waking up. She was absolutely the most insane woman I'd ever met. I thought she was tolerable, until one night.


My Dad had gone, with his band, to play a gig somewhere. I was alone with Matt, Sue, and Sue's friend, Faye. Sue had the ""hilarious"" idea to watch a horror film. Now, I love horror films. But seeing her suddenly jump up and declare we were watching one was weird and, quite frankly, jarring. I suggested Saw just to shut her up, but she said - and this was funny at the time - ""if you want to watch a baby film, that's fine by me!"" (or something similar). We laughed for a bit but then Sue sent Matt upstairs to go to bed (he was too young for something like Saw). Faye was really nice, and I'd made some trading cards for some monsters I'd made up or something on some website.


I was going through them, sometimes printing them off and making little games with them - she would usually join in or at least be interested. Faye seemed almost ""totally"" on my side. What I mean by that is whenever Sue kicked off, Faye would usually defend me in some way. This was no exception.


Sue randomly comes in and dumps a huge box of pictures from when her son, Antony, was in the army. She also goes through some pictures of another son of hers, Ross, and Matt too. This went on for a bit, but then - and this was one of the many jarring things about her - she randomly stood up and exclaimed ""right! film in 10 minutes"" and turned the TV on.


I went to a random number generator to see what Saw film. It said 4 (these details are precise because I wrote down what happened that night in case I had to provide it as evidence). One time, at Dad's old flat, we watched the first paranormal activity movie. I was a bit spooked by some bits, I was 10 years old when we watched it. She suddenly brought that up, saying now we couldn't watch Saw. I protested, she got angry.


She suddenly said that all her children have ""tried it out"" on her, and I was getting upset. She'd obviously been drinking or was just off on some weird mood swing, because she pointed to the door and told me to go to bed. I made out that the evening was becoming unfair, then she said ""I am telling you, as your stepmother, to go to BED"". I was crying by this point, but Faye came with me.


Sue comes barreling up the stairs with her phone in her hand. She tells me it's Dad, and he ""wants to speak with me"". Faye protested saying I didn't want to talk, but she pushed past her and shoved the phone in my face. I pushed it away. She said ""stop hitting me!"". At this point you might see what kind of a person she is - a disgusting, compulsive liar. So I take the phone - Dad said (over the phone) to go and apologize right then and there; I would take myself downstairs and say I was sorry.


So I did - ""Dad said I should say I'm sorry, so I'm sorry"" or something like that. Well, she didn't like that. I apologized to Faye on the way past, she said I shouldn't be sorry; Sue was being unfair. Sue comes running up the stairs again and Dad (over the phone, again) says I shouldn't have said ""Dad said I should"" or something similar. Dad would be home soon, so I was a bit scared. I said something stupid like ""I'm scared of being hurt"" and she went downstairs. A little while later, Sue was heard pacing up and down the downstairs corridor.
""Idiot!""


What happened? Did she break something? Is she shouting to the TV? No.
""You fucking arsehole! You piece of shit! You better PRAY your father still fucking loves you""
I heard Sue and Faye arguing too. Sue shouted, again:


""ANYONE who puts {Dad} down is OUT. they are OUT. NEVER set foot in this house again you FUCKING IDIOT, YOU PIECE OF SHIT""


Dad walks through the door. Sue must have said something like ""your fucking prick of a son"" because Dad went BALLISTIC.


""You, a mother, using language like that about MY SON?"". At this point my Dad was the best person in the world to me. He comes upstairs, turns the light on, and tells me - in an unexpectedly calm tone, to ""pack your bags"". I shoved everything into whatever cases I brought and made my way downstairs.


As I was walking towards the door, Sue was leaning in the doorway shouting ""Well done {Me}! You've got what you wanted, well done! I hope you're fucking happy!"" and Dad pushed her back, shouting ""back off. BACK OFF."" to her. He told me to sit in the car. Sue slammed the door and Dad got into the car.


We drove for ages. Dad kept stopping the car because Sue kept calling him. He had to get out, answer it, get back in, and then carry on driving. The initial plan was to take me back home. But after it became evident it would be a ridiculously long trip back home - what with the calls and such - Dad made the (somewhat crazy) move to go back there.


We both went back - it was like 3:00 to 4:00 AM, so I went to sleep pretty quickly. I was terrified nonetheless. In the morning I left with Dad and got home safely. When I told my Mum about what happened, it turns out Dad only knew half the story concerning the events leading up to ""the outburst"". My Dad says he's never forgotten that and would never forgive her for it.

dcvu3wt,"Recently got into an argument with someone on Reddit, who basically told me people only get piercings to try to be ""edgy"" or whatever so they can get attention from others which I think is total bullshit. So, why do you have the piercings you have/what do you like about having them? ","First and foremost, yes I enjoy my piercings as does my wife.

It's fun knowing that nobody expects myself to have these piercings. ",,,
dof5h77,"I'm reaching out because I feel like I'm going to go crazy and I need to vent. 

I (F) have had a DW for over a decade. We have 3 (adopted) children. MIL is disabled and has had to stay with us throughout the years as her health has fluctuated (her husband died several years ago), and about 2 years ago she moved in permanently. I'm so angry about living with MIL. She is not a pleasant person and has damaged our family. She absolutely hates my oldest child, is terribly rude but can tolerate the middle child, and adores the youngest child more than anything in this world (which is what has pushed me over the edge this week).  

The youngest is only 1 and is the only child that has joined our family after MIL moved in permanently. She has serious boundary issues. She seems to believe that since he didn't come from my body she has equal rights to him (honestly she takes the term ""my baby"" to a new level). For at least the first year she tried to keep all of his clothes in her room. I finally shut that down by buying a new dresser for him so no one could argue with me about where the clothes go (yes, he had an existing dresser but whatever, for some reason using the new one worked). All baby food for him must be kept in her room. She also buys all his food (we are NOT in need of financial help), she buys formula, diapers, whatever he might need and keeps most things in her room. I gave up on diaper wipes---those are practically under lock and key so I store my own secret box in the garage. My DW doesn't understand why any of this would bother me. She just tells me to ""not let it bother me"" or asks ""so what?"" or ""why do you always have to be upset about something?"" Am I crazy for thinking this is inappropriate? 

My breaking point came almost a week ago when DW, myself, and the kids were sitting at the table (baby in the highchair) and MIL decided she wanted to take baby away from the table and in to her room. I asked DW to have MIL leave the baby at the table since we were having a family dinner. DW told her to leave the baby but she said ""No, we are going in here,"" and walked off with him. DW just said to me ""Well I am eating and it would be nice to eat in peace."" She completely sided with MIL and I felt so unimportant. I haven't said more than 10 words to MIL since then. I'm sure she knows I'm upset but doesn't know (or can't) understand why. Actually as i write it I realize she doesn't care why either. 

I feel uncomfortable in my house. I try to spend most of the days now either out of the house or in my room so I don't have to interact with her (baby is with me and she can't do stairs so she can't take him). This is just one example of years of stupid, passive aggressive incidents and rudeness. I sometimes fantasize getting my own place with the kids just to not be with her.

cp3kf3v,"My wife and I have been trying for a second baby for about 3 months now and still have not gotten pregnant. During this time she started baking cupcakes and cake truffles from our home to sell. I created her a website and got some facebook voucher codes for $50 advertising. I tried using the code on mine but I realised it was only for new advertisers only (I had already promoted my fb page so I wasn't eligible). 

How I fucked up: I texted her this morning to tell her I'm gonna log in with her account because it needs a new advertiser in order for the coupon to work. I start creating an ad and in the background I see her IMing her best friend. She asks my wife if the test came out good or bad. I continue creating the ad and try not to read anything but I read her saying it came out positive. 

At this point I call her and tell her I read it. Apparently she had been planning on a cute way to tell me since we started trying. She had her sister order a shirt so it wouldn't show up in our account since I keep up with that daily. The shirt says ""Big Brother"". She was going to have it delivered to our neighbors so that I didn't accidentally get the package. The shirt was supposed to be delivered today and she was going to have my son wear it when I got home.

For those that do not follow the results thread, I got a ""free baby"" a little over 2 weeks ago...betas rose but progesterone, even on supplements was crap. RE suspected ectopic. We had an ultrasound yesterday..I was 5 weeks 5 days and his suspicions were right.  Sac in my left tube.  Surgery was yesterday afternoon.  All care providers were very sweet and helpful. It sucks having to answer ""no, never been pregnant before"". ""About 5.5 weeks along"" and various other pregnancy questions over and over, but it went ok.   


Then comes in the OR nurse... After repeating these questions she tells me ""my first pregnancy was ectopic too.  I know what you are going through"".  Wow I think, this is going to be really great to have someone who gets it..then she adds ""so get this out of the way and you will go on to have great pregnancies after.

This wasn't today, sometime ago in fact.

I got a letter in the post telling me to go for a medical checkup for my life insurance. ""No worries"" said I, munching down on my breakfast bacon butty ""I am a picture of bloody health"". The old ball-and-chain muttered something under her breath which I didn't quite catch - it was either ""fat bastard"" or ""fit barsteward"" but she wouldn't repeat it. I'll go with the barsteward one because I have been known to frequent drinking establishments from time to time but also, memorably, did a press up as a Christmas party trick once. Just the one, mind you, don't want to end up looking like that robot fella, wozisname, Arnold... you know the bloke that whoopsed the hired help and then became a big shot politician. Yeah, that's the fella.

So anyway, I hopped in the ute the next Saturday and headed into town to see the quack. The receptionist told me the doctor was running a bit late - some old fella had swallowed his dentures or something - so I ended up sitting around in the waiting room for about an hour and a half flicking through old copies of Reader's Digest, Horse &amp; Country and Farmers Weekly.

Now, at some point, my guts got sick and tired of waiting around and started fidgeting - rapidly breaking down the mince and cheese pie I'd had for breakfast on the way into town. Mate, traffic was getting seriously backed up at the motorway exit, if you know what I mean. So, I'm sitting there thinking to myself ""Cripes, I’ll have to hold myself down for this one"" and working out a plausible excuse to go and walk around in the car park for a few minutes when the receptionist called me to see the doctor. There was no escape so I did the old reverse swallowing trick is well-known to fellas like me who are prone to the odd bumburp here and there.

Now at this point, I'd just like to describe my doctor. Most doctors are bloody old, smell of Old Spice and piss, and partial to a power nap. Usually these happen while you're describing your symptoms and you end up with a leg cast to treat your hay fever or eye drops for your chapped udders... in small towns doctors can double up as vets, by the way.

Yeah, so our new doctor is not like this at all. She is in her thirties and pretty in a sort of Dr-Quinn-Medicine-Woman kind of way. She's been bloody awesome for the district health levels because there seems to be a lot more bathing and hairbrushing and suchlike amongst the lads, and the fellas now drag the kids off to the doc at the slightest sniffle. Oh and she's bloody posh: you know that ""I drive a Volvo and get someone else to sweep the chook shit of my porch for me"" kind of posh.

So I went into the consulting room and the doctor asked if I'd like a fella to perform the exam. ""Odd"" I thought but anyway, I wouldn't want Mick the orderly there to get all involved - he'd spend an hour talking footy and I've got bloody fences to mend! So I said no.
So we did the pulse thing, and the ears, eyes, throat thing, blow in this tube, stand on the scale, blah-de-blah-de-blah. Then she asked if I would undress to my underwear and lie on the bench as she needed to check for hernias and a testicular cancer.

O-kay.

Things began to get very tricky as she was doing her checks extremely thoroughly - I was frantically trying to sing the national anthem backwards to myself whilst mentally yelling at my downstairs ""DON'T YOU BLOODY MOVE!"". Let’s just say I ignored myself. Embarrassed as, I tried to bluster through an explanation she just gave me an ""I've seen it all before don't you worry"" smile, patted my on my shoulder and then said that she needed to do a prostate exam. I would need to lower my briefs and lie on my side. ""Odd"" I thought again but only briefly as I was trying to tuck my errant old fella away out of sight.

Now at this point, I would like to make a serious complaint about the education system of the seventies and eighties. No-one explained enough about the prostate when you're at school. Most blokes don't know what it is, let alone where it is or how it’s checked. All we know is its in the section of the school textbook where there are pictures of naked people that other students over the years have decorated with little spectacles and moustaches, arrows, people's names and suchlike.

So I was lying there still smarting from embarrassment when suddenly it felt like the doctor rammed a log of firewood up my nethers. ""A bit taken aback"" is probably the politest way of describing my reaction but she persisted, rummaging around like Santa searching his grotto for a present and I swear at one point she might have been in up to her bloody elbow. If this wasn't enough, the mince and cheese pie and my over-active metabolism came back to haunt me. I farted long and hard and, my holy fuck, it smelled like it came from the deepest depth of Satan's own backside. I can quite comfortably say that the embarrassment of becoming sexually aroused during a hernia and testicular exam pales into insignificance when you fart in a doctors face.
So, needless to say, I haven't been back to the Doctor for a year and a half. My missus says the doctor often asks after me and I suspect there's been a bit of a breach of doctor/patient confidence because she always sniggers when she tells me this. Oh, and I saw the receptionist in the supermarket a month after the exam and she was laughing uncontrollably and pretending she had read something amusing on the back of a cereal packet. Personally, I’ve never seen anything on a cornflakes box that is THAT funny so she must know too.

This is why I hate insurance salesman - if it wasn't for them I'd still be mates with my doctor.

TL;DR TIFU by farting during a prostate exam

Edit: So to answer a bunch of things...

• 'Cheers' to those who said they enjoyed reading this pile of dung. 'Fair enough' to those who called it a festering heap of shite. 'Couldn't have put it better myself' to those who said I talked for ages, said very little, was unentertaining, and had the writing ability of a high school eejit. If you thought it was rubbish, down vote the hell out of it, democracy is a beautiful thing. 

• I'm an old fella and old farts like us ramble. On purpose. Mostly because it is annoying but also because it's habit after decades of pre-Internet tale-swapping in pubs. It is what it is... down vote the hell out of it.

• Is it true? Yes. Is it embellished, over the top, and flowered up? Oh fuck yes! Is farting on a doctor really a fuck up? Maybe not for her. Either way, doe vote the hell out of this turd if you think it is shit.

• Happened in a little town in Essex when I was over there for ten years or so. Us colonials tend to travel a bit before settling down to shagging sheep and getting tattooed (or whatever anyone thinks is normal of Kiwis)!

• I encourage you again to down vote this spew-laden shit-post. I just enjoyed writing it down. 

Edit 2: Thank you things...

A big cheers to coolaccount2 (whose user name understates how awesome he actually is - good on yer mate) who encouraged me to kill myself for crimes against writing and being a shit stain upon the world. Look, I love your passion and agree that the world could do with fewer shit stains upon it but I couldn't top myself before killing every pair of undies that I own for being guilty too. 

Oh and fella who coined the phrase 'overwrought maturbatory prose', I love that! Cheers for a great chuckle. Or snigger, which someone told me is an unacceptable word. 

And anyone who had a laugh at a really stupid story, I'd have a beer with you any time. 

Edit 3: Today I learned that putting the TL;DR at the top and adding the words 'long as shitpost' to it would be wise if I ever try this again :-) 

Also thanks again to coolaccount2 who's continued advice on preventing further abuse of the written word by me shrugging off this mortal wozisname has been insightful and entertaining. I did Google your suggestion and yeah, nah. Thank for your help mate.

I’d probably make a little divider and store cutlery in the top drawer, and spices, grains, baking goods, etc in the deeper ones below. You could even stack skillets and point the handles into the triangular corners at the front.

dfezwzx,"Here's something else that just occurred to me.

Imagine the FE model with the flat disk and all that. Then imagine a giant upside-down salad bowl covering the disk with holes poked in it representing stars. At the very top of this bowl would be the north star, and every other star rotates around it as the bowl spins. Would everyone here agree that this is an accurate model of the FE sky?

Next, pick the spot on the flat earth where you live. Look *south*. As the night sky progresses, what do you see the stars doing?

You'd see the stars moving in a *straight line* from east to west, wouldn't you? As the bowl rotates, those stars (as you face south) should move straight across your field of vision.

But that's not what we see. We see an arc in their path across the sky. How do flat earthers explain this? It's a simple question. Why do the stars to your south *not* move in a flat path like they would if a giant dome was spinning above your head?","your flat earth is also accelerating up. it explains the star movements and gravity. those are not holes in a bowl, they are celestial beings and they are dancing lol",,,

- They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be.
- They're surprisingly well behaved.
- Bead balancing works. They're perfectly balanced (tested up to 100kph)
- At highway speeds they're a tiny bit flighty as they do not fit into the road groves worn by normal vehicles.
- Under 5 kph you can feel every lug.
- Turning under 15 kph feels like something is dragging (but it's normal)
- No huge loss in power, even with the auto.
- Shift points are still reasonable on the auto.
- Jeep is reporting that I lost 0.5 L/100KM around town, some of it can be attributed to the fact I haven't gotten my ProCal yet to set the tire size as I'm actually traveling further per tire rotation than the computer thinks I am.

- They're large compared to other 35s.

coedlph,"In the very long run, and averaged across all possible investments, it is reasonable to expect equity (stocks) to outperform debt (bonds), for exactly the reason you state. But that's a very theoretical concept, and it only applies outside of an RRSP/TFSA/whatever.

In practice, we know for sure that interest from corporate bonds is not taxed in the corporation's hands and is fully taxed in the recipient's hands at their marginal rate: this tax can be completely cancelled by keeping the bonds in an RRSP/TFSA/whatever. Corporate ""profit"" distributed in this way is completely free of tax (because legally it is an expense rather than profit).

We also know for sure that corporate profits are taxed at 15% (+provincial tax rate) in the hands of the corporation before any dividends can be issued and before any earned income can be retained. As a result, the recipients of dividends and capital gains are given tax breaks to compensate them for this pre-taxing. Unfortunately, placing a stock inside an RRSP/TFSA/whatever means these tax breaks are wasted.

The fact that stocks statistically outperform bonds in the long run is not enough to make up for this sub-optimal taxation thing.",Thanks! So if I understand you correctly- bonds should take preference over stock (even international stock) in my sheltered account(s).,,,

cp98x3u,"My favorite bands is Disturbed. Growing up I was on a deep suicidal depression for most of my life. A huge majority of my depression was caused be me being transgender. While growing up I didn't think anyone would understand what I was going through so I did my best to hide it. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make the feelings of wanting to be female go away and these feelings would last throughout the day everyday. The wanting to end my life became a daily thing too.

One of the biggest things that helped me cope with my depression was music. I fell in love with Disturbed immediately. Even though the songs weren't about gender identity issues (I hadn't heard of any that were until I came out) a lot of the emotions that came with the songs I felt still applied to my feelings. Some of the songs I felt could be applied to what I was going through and a lot of them go from the feeling of being beaten to standing up again and fighting until the end. Their music helped me through so much of my depression when I couldn't talk to anybody about what I was going through.

c150sp1,"Cursive writing and recognition was taught because it was how adults communicated with one another quickly... in the past. Modern day adults (and most teenagers) use computers for quick communication, and there are less and less usages for cursive writing. Personally I can't remember the last time I had to write anything long by hand.

Efficient typing skills, on the other hand, is absolutely essential for day-to-day life. It will also probably only increase in importance compared to writing cursive. I meet far too many adults in the work force who still can't  type properly, and it drives me absolutely insane that they don't have the basic skills necessary. This is not to say to not teach how to write *print* form, otherwise known as block letters. Children should of course know how to write with pen and paper, just not specifically *cursive* form. 

Also, keep in mind that arguments like ""well most teenagers know how to type"" doesn't relate to curriculum. First and Second grade teaches things that seem like perfectly common knowledge, such as ""how to tell time"", ""identify shapes"", and ""recognize and write numbers up to 100"". It's not about what you as an adult would like to learn, but rather what should be part of a core skill taught.

Edit: of course if there is resource to teach both then they should teach both, but this is under the hypothetical that there isn't extra resources and time for it. We could talk about reforming public education systems as well.

de8fqur,"Don't worry about it. Most managers manage by spread sheet. They can see wages as an expense they can control. Reduce hours and look at all the money we saved!

c36o1fa,"Hello Reddit! I come to you in a time of need.
Here's a little bit of a back story. I'm 22, she's 20 and we've been together for 8 and half months now. We probably see each other five to six days a week, and sleep in the same bed five times a week. I'd like to say we're very much in love, and I'm as attracted to her now as on our first date. To me, she's beautiful, smart, and funny and I can trust her with anything. As of the last two months we've been having issues with sex, her sex drive has vanished. I would say that we have sex roughly twice a week, maybe less. However, I feel like she's doing it solely to humor me and I really don't want to ever force her to have sex. Its worth mentioning that the first six months together were sex-filled and I didn't have a complaint in the world.

I can honestly and truthfully say that I try my hardest to make her happy. I take her out to dinner, movies, get along great with her friends, be supportive and affectionate towards her, and generally love the time we spend together. If I can help her out, I will do it. The issue is that I've gotten so used to her rejecting me for sex, that I barely even try anymore. It's gotten to the point where it is crushing my self esteem and making me feel unappreciated. Most recently, I tried being spontaneous by bringing her breakfast in bed, then showering and going for the morning sex before I drove her to work, but received the classic No.

I've voice my concerns three times now, and told her how I feel unappreciated, and originally she said she would try to initiate sex more often. That was roughly two months ago, and she has initiated sex once since then. Basically I feel like our relationship is fading away, even though she assures me it isn't. This girl means the world to me, and I never want to lose her, but it's being extremely mentally and emotionally taxing on me when I don't feel appreciated or desired.

Basically what I'm asking is how can I get my girlfriend to want me like she did before? What can I do for her? I'm out of answers, and really don't know what to do anymore.



EDIT: Just got off the phone with her.  Laid it all on the line, told her that how I feel unappreciated and that I don't turn her on.  She assured me that I was wrong and that she's still in love/attracted to me.  We're gunna talk tonight and she's going to think of ways to make me feel appreciated.

EDIT#2:  Need more input, has anyone else had similar situations/what happened?  Keep in mind I am not willing to break up with her over this matter, outside of this I am very much happy.",Seems like something happened that she's not telling you. Legit to be concerned and feel shitty about it.,,,

choaf88,"Tl;Dr My neighbors are generous people that anyone would be lucky to live next to, except that that are pushy and invasive and unnaturally obsessed with my pregnancy. They are trying to force us into being a family of some kind. 



Ok, they really are great people. We live in the country and both have a bit of land. The 5 acre property line we share is an overgrown fence row so we work together to clear it. Whenever DH is outside working the neighbor will come lend a hand. He's an older guy (new grandpa) but very active and able, so senility isn't the issue. He's been very helpful since we are new to the country and lack many of the costly tools and machinery needed to maintain a big place. We are so grateful for his help and we try to reciprocate with free eggs from our chickens and any other assistance we can provide. 

When his wife found out I was pregnant she was very excited, a little too excited. She immediately brought over a pack-n-play her two year old granddaughter had outgrown. I was moved by the generosity. That week she came over with some infant clothes, toys, and a small stroller as well. Again, I thanked her profusely. I have a small house and at 8 weeks I didn't have a nursery yet so the stuff was becoming a pile, but I was still very grateful. 

Then she told me she was bringing diapers over that the little girl had outgrown. I thanked her but said she should donate them to someone in need because I was planning to cloth diaper. That's when the unsolicited advice started. She said I was welcome to try but her DIL had tried and failed so I might as well just stock up on diapers because I would need them. 

Then she tried to forcibly *loan* me her 35 year old drop side crib. Loan, because she was sentimentally attached, but she wanted me use it  indefinitely. Folks, I don't borrow things long-term unless I know I can replace them, and I can't replace a family crib. Besides that it's an old-fashioned death trap. I politely declined but she called me repeated trying to force me to take it until I finally lied and said my mom wanted to buy us a crib. 

Since then they've told us they wanted to be called as soon as we found out gender, they want to know when I go in labor, and told us they consider themselves the grandparents. They also expect to babysit. Doesn't all that sound wonderful? Really, they haven't done anything wrong. But they are so pushy. We aren't orphans. My parents live 15 minutes away. This LO already has 3 sets of grandparents who are actual family. I'm very uncomfortable having the next door neighbors just forcing their way in. 

The other day my husband was over there with the son (they are kinda friends but not really) and she asks if she's invited to my baby shower, and then begs an invite for her daughter-in-law. My shower is small, friends and family, and my mom is paying for it. But because they have done so much I felt obligated to invite them. Then the son texts my husband to ask if there will be men there so he can come, too! I didn't put his name on the invite. I don't know his wife at all but I figure she is uncomfortable going and wanted him there with her. Wtf? 

My house has become the dump for every baby thing they want to get rid of. Toys and things that mine won't be able to use for years are piling up. Used oragel, baby lotion and shampoo, ratty towels, anything, they just fill a bag and drop it off. I've told them that I have everything I need and they should find someone in need, but to no avail. How can I stop them without seeming ungrateful? I appreciate the newborn stuff, but I don't have the storage for every new piece of crap that girl outgrows. Their parenting style is very different from mine and I don't necessarily want the kinds of toys and clothes that they buy for her. Give it away, you say? Well, the grandma actually asked for some of the stuff back months after she gave it to me, then got pissy when I didn't get it to her as soon as she wanted. 

There are other things. They tried to tell us how we should vote back in November. She tried to get me to babysit for free, casually mentioning all the stuff to let me know she considered that the least I could do. This was in my first trimester when I was constantly sick. I told her I would try to be available but I had many obligations (maid of honor, multiple showers to plan, tons of doctors appts. and classes) and she basically said that because I don't have a job I couldn't be as busy as her. Thank goodness she hadn't even consulted her kids because they weren't comfortable with a total stranger watching their daughter, so I never had to do it. 

They insisted we take down a section of fence to make passing between the two properties easier, despite my protests that our dog would get out. They did it anyway. Today my dog got out and my pregnant (and very much in pain) ass had to go cross-country hiking to get her back. 

They haven't done anything wrong on paper, but they constantly insert themselves in our lives. They talk about us being family all the time. They have a family! We have a family! If I wanted to live next door to family I would have brought a house on my parent's street. I moved her for peace and privacy. I don't want pushy people knocking on my door all the time to shove stuff down my throat. Yet, I can't say a word because they have been kind and generous. I want good neighbors and I want a good relationship with them, but being too close with people who aren't really family is a recipe for disaster. If something goes sour we still have to share a property line, and they make whole movies about the drama that comes from that. 

I just know it's going to be worse when the baby comes. I don't know what I'll do if they start banging on the door while I'm trying to nurse and recover. 

If you read all that, thanks. I just needed to get it out. 

Edit: And this isn't all of it. I could write a book with all the ways they have forced themselves into our lives and all the crazy stuff they say. ","Could your parents be the ones to get this couple, crazy lady, to back off? If the real grandparents made a big noise about being present maybe they would calm down. You could for example start a big obvious job and then when the neighbours spot and come around, grandparents could say that no help was needed as it is a grandparents job getting everything ready for LO.

ccwjii3,"We're having our halloween party this saturday and I can't wait! 
For food I'm setting up a nacho bar with all kinds of toppings and my friends are bringing some sweets like cauldron cakes and halloween candy bark (which is basically sugar crack.)

I have a few different games we're playing. One game I'm doing is kind of like a scavenger hunt but everyone pairs off to hunt for tiny orange spider rings I've hid around the yard. The catch is, on each team, one person is blindfolded and the other has their hands tied around their back and only the blindfolded person is allowed to actually pick up and collect the spider rings. The person whose hands are tied can only lead them. And of course, the team with the most spider rings wins. I did this before at a christmas party (except with candy canes instead) and it was a lot of fun. 

We're also doing the winking killer game throughout the night. When they come in, they pick up a paper tombstone that has different ways to die on the back. (Such as dancing to death, poison by punch, ect.) One of the tombstones will declare its picker to be the murderer for the night. This person has to slyly wink at people throughout the night and then the victim has to wait 2 mins and then act out the death they received when they arrived. It should prove to be entertaining. 

And lastly we'll be playing a rendition of Werewolves of Millers Hollow but that'll take forever to type out all the rules so I'll link you to the wiki: http://www.games-wiki.org/wiki/Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow/

ddn3mfa,"I understand that people think points should have been deducted for the late punches (and I agree). But given that points were not deducted, why do people still feel like Holm should have gotten the decision? I'd like you hear your opinions.  

Edit: So I feel like I should offer my rationale for why I thought GDR won, a lot of people have argued that Holly should be awarded points for controlling GDR against the fence, I personally don't think that holding someone against the fence inherently means you're winning. It gives you the advantage if you intend to strike in the clinch or go for a takedown, but if you don't effectively do those things you should not be rewarded for holding someone against the cage, If that constitutes as ""octagon control"" then GDR should be rewarded just as much for controlling the center of the octagon for the majority of the fight when they were not clinching. I gave Holly the rounds where she scored KDs, I thought that was pretty clear, In the other 3 rounds the vast majority of he strikes were blocked or dodged, GDR landed more strikes and harder strikes to the head and though Holly landed more leg kicks I also believed that GDR landed the much more damaging leg kicks.

I thought it was clear that Holly was getting out struck at range against GDR, she knew it as well which is why she constantly looked to clinch, but she was largely ineffective in the clinch. 3-2 GDR (though Holly should have won due to point deductions). ",I think the biggest reason I scored it for Holly was because she was WAY more active. She was setting the pace of the fight idk. She also hit her with the left during the 5th I think which practically dropped Germaine (she held on to Holly) Those are my reasons. Im no super analyst though so yeaaa,,,

It sounds like perhaps a greater effort to give information about secular options would help.  Of course, that would involve at least a partial acknowledgement that AA is indeed a religious and theistic-based program, and I don't know how that would go over.

cuh5bwq,"I've put an extended backstory in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3iivya/i_think_im_unhireable/cugt4ob), for anyone who wants to wade through a bigger wall of text to get the whole story.  The basics are, I'm on disability (for Aspergers and related social issues, not for anything physical), but recently decided I want a part-time job just to buttress my income a little and give me a little more safety margin.  I calculated that just $300 a month would put me in pretty decent shape, and even at a low wage, that's only like 10 hours a week.  Even with my issues, I figured I could grit my teeth through that much.  It would put me in a much more stable financial situation and I would have some degree of safety net if the disability ever went away for some reason.

But now that I've started looking again, it doesn't seem achievable.  I was bad enough at getting jobs before I went on disability, but I'm even worse now.  I currently have a gap in my employment history that's over a year long (and it's only gonna get longer), and I really have no clue what to say to them about why I left my last job.  I stopped in at a Subway near where I live, and saw that they were hiring.  Fast food is really not at all something I want to do, but again, it's only ten hours a week.  Also, it's extremely close to home (commuting is also a problem for me), and I like their sandwiches, so the free/discounted food would be welcome.  So, I went home and went online to apply.  Sure enough, one of the questions in the Employment History form was ""why did you leave this job?""  What am I supposed to say to that?  ""I left because I hate being around people, please hire me for this customer-oriented position?""

Then, after slogging through that page, I thought I was done with the application, but then it gave me the dreaded personality/psych test.  You know, the one where it has a statement and you rate it from ""Strongly Agree"" to ""Strongly Disagree.""  I have a history with those, too, and I think a real case could be made that they directly discriminate against people on the spectrum.  It had statements like ""I tend to not talk a lot at parties.""  I know how those things work; basically my two options are tell a bald-faced lie, or give up any chance of being hired.  I chose the second option.  Since the test was six pages long, I didn't even bother to waste my time finishing it.  

The whole thing (combined with all the other various and sundry bad experiences I've had since I started looking for work again) left me feeling very humiliated and depressed.  I suppose not being able to get a job because of conditions like this is exactly why disability income exists, but it stills feels like a very unsteady and undependable situation, to do nothing but hope that it doesn't disappear at some point.  If I does, I am legitimately screwed. ","Instead of focusing on work or getting a job, why not use this opportunity to better understand yourself and your talents? What is an extra $300/mo really going to do for you over the long term? If disability is paying all your bills, and probably for mental health treatment, you have a great opportunity to improve your understanding of yourself, your talents, your brain, Asperger's, autism, etc... Not trying to discount your efforts, just offering a different perspective.",,,

cb76s4y,"Hello! I was thinking as I was walking/running this morning, about all the fat women on this site that are completely voracious when pursuing extremely thin guys. I have a theory. 

I am a fat girl married to a thin man. I wasn't always fat, but now I find myself at 5'7"" and 250lbs (and losing). I want to clarify that I am fat, but I am not a hamplanet. I am polite to people and have no condishuns. I don't even drink soda.  When my husband and I fell in love, I was a lot thinner. I think the thinnest I have ever been has been 145lbs, but I have always been fairly athletic, and even fat, I don't have any health problems, and am able to walk/run 3-4 miles with no problem. I just hate doing it. This is a whole other thing. 

The point is, I realized that I am naturally attracted to really tall, thin guys. All my serious relationships have been with tall, thin men. I am also attracted to tall, thin women (think Cate Blanchett, or Gwyneth Paltrow). And so I thought, what is it about that body type that I love so much? And then I thought, well, I have never been skinny. Even when I was in the best shape of my life, I have always had wide hips and large breasts (my first bra was a B cup). 

So maybe I am just attracted to something different than myself, but also, something that I really wish I could be, i.e. rail thin and not needing to wear a bra. So maybe the hamplanets on here that are constantly throwing themselves at people who are much, much thinner than they are, and much much more attractive, is just their way of sublimating their own poor body image and trying to achieve their ideal vicariously through someone else. This seems really obvious now, but anyway it was just a thought I had today while exercising so that hopefully someday I will be thin and athletic again, even if I'm always going to be curvy. 

**TL;DR** Fat girls go after skinny guys because they want what they will never be.
","Sounds legit. 

Also, I feel your pain on the bra thing. I'm short, with wide hips and big boobs. It's impossible to find clothes that don't make me look and feel fat. (without being skin tight hooker clothes) Even when I was 118 lbs. And, I too have always wanted to be tall with little perky boobs that didn't need a bra. Boooohoooohooo!

djn4iri,"You should show us the source data, so that we can tell you what to do.

The task seems really simple to be honest (assuming that you dont need to transform your data) and ones that suggest power pivot sound like utter nonsense. The tool is not important here, the data visualization (what you want) is important. I guess you dont want to see some table with 1000s of employees. Maybe slicers here could work, to make it interactive.

You could start by making a simple pivot for the whole company that shows: actual number of hours versus total number of hours (you probably need to add total number of hours to your source data - that;'s why I asked how it looks). This is basically the 'overview for whole company'. The best would be to make this pivot table on basis of a named range, so later on you will simply copy it.

Then copy this table to have a table for each region, but also add shops names (mabe employee's names as well? but this would be hard to read probabluy). This will allow you to show ""results of regions"".

Another copy: show the top 10 best and top 10 worst employees.

But without seeing the data, it's hard to tell what you need. A pivot table can aggregate the data somehow (maybe on shop level, maybe on region level) - hard to say what you have.

I focus on world design and building and i am specifically working in unreal engine 4. When I say that I compare my work, I generally mean on a conceptual level, but also when I finish something that is remotely playable, I try to add just a dash of the world that was crafted in Bioshock.

ccmjfd9,"So basically I am about to endeavor on a spiritual journey of renunciation, meditation, letting go of things like sense gratification etc.

I have put out some postings on various social networking sites and have received quite a bit of interest so if you have the time and patience I'd love for you to give this a read and give me any advice, comments, or precautions for when i set out on this journey with fellow spiritual seekers.

&gt;For many on the spiritual path it can be not only unsafe to travel alone and confront our daily lives with a mindset of devotion to god But also We can get constantly caught up in the distraction of materialistic music, movies, videos, and getting involved in conversations so far from the concept of just being in this present moment that our lives change from a focus on god, nature, Reality just as it is and instead Go from distraction, to sense gratification, to confusions and anxieties.

&gt;When we first hear about self-realization the first thing we want to do is meet new people and show our love for them.
But as our mind begins to open up and become accepting we can experience problems such as attracting too much attention that can interfere with many peoples business. When that happens we once again start building a story around ourselves whether it be based on money or just ego-propagation it can interfere and create dangerous situations for those on the path of devotion to god/nature/reality.

&gt;I would like to start finding people for a long term commitment to each other where we would mainly be traveling on foot,hitchhiking, train-hopping, and going on various meditation retreats.
This is only a means of getting people together for fellowship so any and all means of travel would be great.

&gt;The main thing is just being able to give our lives over to renunciation from distraction, sense gratification, and of course all these ideas we have about ourselves and other people.
And worst of all Our ideas of what other people think of us and our ideas. These things must be let go of if we wish to make real progress on the path of self-realization.

&gt;The most important thing for us to pursue in this human life is self-realization.

&gt;We would be Busking, preaching, teaching, meditating, sharing, communicating, and recruiting more lost souls to create a sustainable environment for us to practice spirituality with community based on traveling and showing others what god really means.. Love. Acceptance.

&gt;It would of course start small but really the possibilities are endless.

&gt;Right now this is just an idea but with only a few like-minded people this could become something much more real.

&gt;Feel free to pm me or just reply to this post.
I'm extremely serious about this and see this as an important step in the development of spiritual purity and a chance at something great.

Also I'm sure it would be alot of fun.

Looking forward to hearing from anyone and everyone for comments, opinions, or whatever.

Thanks ahead of time, Disco.**

Also research the original cures for cancer. Today the marketing side claims the 'gamma-knife' cuts with atomic precision. Yet the original cures or treatments merely dumped radioactive material on peoples' chests.

Well I ride home after that and make some dumb joke about me shivering on my bike, I get nervous for no reason because she didn't respond AT 2 AM. SHE'S PROBABLY JUST ASLEEP. But no, I start second guessing and send another message ""Well that didn't sound like how imagine...""

c7066iy,"My story:

When I was 13 a doctor wrote me an adult dose for a certain medicine based on my weight. I was a fat kid. Our body does not work that way and the medicine ended up constipating me...for a month. I did not shit for a whole month. I got sick. I had racoon-like eyes, my stomach would jump or flutter by itself, I had cramps, etc. It was bad. I was miserable. 

I finally told my parents how long it had been since i had shit and they freaked out and took me to the hospital. There, they gave 3 enemas back to back. After the third and final one, all that water softened all that shit up just enough i could expel it. I ran to the nearest bathroom, gown open in the back, and tried to make it to the toilet. 

I didn't

My ass was hovering at a 45 degree angle above the toilet when the geyser burst. This next part is not a lie, but i know some of you will think it is, I got shit everywhere. On the ceiling (somehow), on the floor, the toilet was covered, the walls, even the sink got hit with some spray. Shit was literally, yes literally, sprayed on all walls and ceiling. It was everywhere. 

I felt like a new kid after that. Cleaned myself up the best i could and then had to figure out what to do. There was no way i could clean it all up, I needed a janitor. So I walked out and politely told a nurse the bathroom need a clean up and badly. 

A janitor was only a few rooms down for some reason so I saw him go by to clean it, but he did not know who i was, he got to the bathroom and the whole ER heard, ""Oh Hell no, I ain't cleaning this up. I quit."" and he did. 

I felt so bad, still do. I made some poor janitor quit his job over a shit-caked bathroom.

cjgxex6,"Zoloft worked GREAT for me. Look at my post history for my whole story, but I felt a lot better by the time I got to 50 mg, and a whole world better at 75. Friends and family have all been commenting on the positive change. 

Initially you may feel MORE anxious for a few weeks. This is normal. You may also feel drowsy, foggy, tired, ""out of it"". I agree that it helps to record your daily thoughts and feelings on the med. 

Only lasting side effects so far is some trouble sleeping through the night (wake up frequently feeling fully rested) and some sexual side effects. 

If you are the type to ""imagine"" symptoms when anxious, I would recommend using a benzo like Xanax or Klonopin when you first start the med and then weaning off of it. My therapist and psychiatrist both recommended this and it got me through the first weeks without panicking and imagining side effects (as I can often do when super anxious) and going off the med. I made it through and I am getting better every day, with some ups and downs but overall SO MUCH better. 

PM me if you have any other questions. I am a biology teacher, so I was really interested in the science of how SSRI's work. It is fascinating stuff. They can actually cause your brain to downregulate receptors that are responsible for anxiety and encourage neurogenesis (brain repair/growth) in your hippocampus that can permanently relieve anxiety.  My psychiatrist says 62% of people treated with SSRI never have to take anxiety meds again. The remaining percentages may need to periodically take SSRI after significant life stressors (death of a loved one, etc.) . The percentage of people for which SSRI's do not work is actually VERY SMALL. It may feel like otherwise reading through this subreddit, but keep in mind that it is a  very biased sample.

Why am I still posting here after my anxiety has gotten so much better due to Zoloft? I think because I want to encourage others to try the drug that helped me so much. I KNOW I could not have done this through positive thinking, CBT, exercise, etc., alone. I needed the Zoloft, and I was lucky to have a great therapist and supportive family that encouraged me and reassured me through the process of going on the SSRI. Please don't get scared off by horror stories. Each person is unique, and the chances are in your favor to respond positively to the med. 

PM me anytime.
","Thank you for all the useful information (:
I am definitely the type to start imagining symptoms and it seriously drives me crazy sometimes, if I do start to experience that I'll be sure to talk to my doc though. I hope in terms of side effects I don't have anything too severe but as far as what you've said it shouldn't be hard for me to deal with. I really do appreciate all of that though, I hope the Zoloft works for me, I wanna start feeling good again.",,,

dbyk62z,"You can curl your hair with two strand twists or with hair rollers. 

Two strand twists or braids- You pull your curls until they're stretched out, add moisturizer, separate into two small sections and twist together, repeat all over your head. Leave in over night out or sit under a hooded drier. When you take out the twists, your hair will appear curled. If you have type 3 hair you should finish with a little bit of hair spray. You can also achieve a similar effect with braids, but the curl pattern will be slightly different. 

Rollers- Stretch out your hair using a blow drier. It doesn't have to be bone straight, because you put it in rollers either way. Keep them in overnight, or dry them under a hooded drier with whatever moisturizer you need. Again you should probably finish with hair spray when you take the rollers out.

There are a lot of tutorials on this, just search ""two strand twist out natural hairstyles"", ""braid out natural hairstyles"" or ""curl natural hair with rollers"" on Youtube. It's pretty much the same rules for type 3 and 4 hair when it comes to curling for the most part. I don't often change the texture of my hair, so I am not 100% on all of the steps. You should definitely look up a tutorial on youtube. 

[TM Products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvhB8Q89LSc) has a product called Smooth Thru Detangler which I have heard good reviews of and have been meaning to try. It's a moisturizer and leave in conditioner primarily used for changing the texture of the hair. You could also use a pressing oil (just type in 'pressing oil' into Amazon) as a moisturizer.

It was my first time surfing a lowkey spot and i had one of my best sessions there. This was when i was really kook and had a 9ft longboard too haha. But the guy and i decided to ride the closeouts about 50yards to the north of it and had it all to ourselves. There were about 10 people out and when it emptied out to about 5 people we begun riding the point waves. Eventually the high tide came in and swamped the place out.

So this actually happened yesterday, but since it was less than 24 hours ago I figured it still counts.  
  I left my apartment to go pick up my kid and do some shopping for a sick friend.  As I was pulling out of my complex, I realized that I forgotten my phone.  Seeing as though I was still in the parking lot, I pulled around and rather than park in a space, I decided to leave my car running behind a few cars parked in front of my building.  Now, recently my car has been doing this things where the electric locks (which have been fried for a while) have been randomly engaging while I drive.  This wouldn't be too much of a problem except that the lock mechanism itself in the drivers side door is screwed up so its really hard to unlock from inside.  So I unlock my door, get out of the car and shut the door behind me.  Then thinking better of it, I decide to leave the door open a little so it doesn't randomly lock me out.  It was too late.  I was locked out of my car for 90 minutes, and the whole time the engine was running. My kid ended up having to get a ride home with her friend and I was late to pick up my GF.   Stupid locks.  

TL;DR, shut the locked door (that I thought was unlocked) with keys in the ignition and car running, waited 90 minutes to get it unlocked.",Lol you think think that's bad I had to get up at six in the morning to bring my sister her spare key because she had locked herself out of her car.

I had lies of knowing the future that all of us believed and an unwavering hope that could make them come true.  I had grace and charm.  I had charisma.  I had the famous last words of every noble man that ever lived scribbled on my palm.  I had absolutely every single regret that anyone in all the world had ever held within their heart smeared beneath my feet and scraped off on the curb.  I had a long-lost father telling me how proud he was of every child he walked away from.  I had today.  I had tomorrow.  I had infinity.  I had infinity times infinity.  I had this moment and every other moment spent doing anything except telling you how much I love you.  Wrapped up in a box.  With a tag that reads 'do not open ‘til your birthday.'

This app takes effect any time you tap something that needs to be loaded in a browser. Instead of opening it in your default browser a bubble will appear on your screen and the link will load in that. I can tap a link I want to view and look at it right away, or leave it and continue what I'm doing and check it out after. You can load multiple links at a time (it will stack) and the bubble is about the same size as the FB messenger ones. I like it for redditing, since I'm opening so many external links and the bubbles load/close faster than using firefox every time. You can always make the bubble open into your browser after if you need to. ",Thank you so much for unified remote. This will be oh so nice,,,
c9g5mml,"Me and some friends were hanging out one evening, we decided to hit the town because one of my friends  was feeling a bit depressed. We hit a couple bars up and were walking back home on the road next to a forest (it's a heavily wooded area). Through the bush I spied a man on a trail, he had dropped his hat  and was looking at it quite oddly. Thinking he was drunk, I walked up to him and said ""excuse me, sir, but I do believe you have dropped your hat."" he looked at me with a terror and said, ""Clever girl..."" then swung around and fired a gun at me! He missed (thank God), and me and my buddies beat him up pretty good for that.. Anyways we went home and my friend told us that he was secretly attracted to herbivores.

ciifi8h,"That was my first thought about the Mortal Instruments too. I was really hesitate cause it seemed Twilight like based on the trailer but I like it.

I never have cried that much reading. I'm currently reading Allegiant and its great so far (I put it off cause of it having the movie made too). I also loove the Selection Series.  Im usually not a romantic type but loved the series. I thought of a couple more suggestions since I'm off work now. 
-Rainbow Rowell (I can't just pick one book from her. They are all amazing in their own way. I would read Fangirl first. Its about a girl who writes Harry Potter like fan fiction. My second favorite is Attachments and then Eleanor and Park.)
-The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer (Fantasy retelling of classic fairytales mixed with like a steampuckish environment.  It starts with Cimder but the other books Scarlet and Cinder are much better)
You probably have too many books to read but they are great in their own way.  ",Maybe I'll check out Mortal Instruments eventually. Attachments is already on my list actually!

I have had some form of nicotine every day for 9 years. Damn...

I am volunteering on a farm and ran out of cigarettes and have no means to get more. This is not the way I wanted to quit. I am furious at everything and cannot concentrate. I have to mentally block the impulse of going for a smoke several times an hour.

I am turning to herbal remedies and distractions to try and take the edge off.

I'm hoping this time tomorrow I will be feeling better. At least from the nicotine withdrawal.

I am considering staying abstinent after this. But a part of me is so angry for having run out of smokes, that I will go buy a pack when I leave here, and smoke the shit out of them.

 * Also check out /r/photoclass2015 and /r/photoclass.
   
 * Using the Album Thread is a great way to learn, by both forcing yourself to select which of your photos are worth sharing, and by judging other people's albums, which forces you to think about what you like in other people's photos.
   
 * If you want to buy a camera, take a look at [our Buyer's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index#wiki\_what\_can\_i\_afford.3F) or [www.dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/)
   
 * If you want a camera to learn on, or a first camera, the beginner camera market is very competitive, so they're all pretty much the same in terms of price/value. Just go to a shop and pick one that feels good in your hands.
   
 * Canon vs. Nikon? Just choose whichever one your friends/family have, so you can ask them for help (button/menu layout) and/or borrow their lenses/batteries/etc.

dj8gq4v,"Hey fellow leavers.

I slipped up. I lost control. No, I didn’t smoke weed, in fact, I haven’t smoked for more than three months, so this is totally out of place. No matter. I like this community as a community to turn to when I feel down and when I feel good both. Today’s more of a down day, I’m in a depression spiral, also diagnosed with major depression. I don’t like posting to r/depression because they only drag each other down, so I post here, hope everybody’s cool with that. I think this rant could be interesting for the users here nonetheless.

Anyway. Last week I didn’t smoke cigarettes for a few days, which I was happy about, then I went on a bender on Friday, which lasted till Saturday morning, and I smoked cigarillos and cigarettes. I don’t know why I did that (both parts). I guess I like to sabotage myself, or at least that’s how it feels. Then I was dead for two days. So depressed, so emotional. Foolishly, I also went on Facebook and saw a pic of my ex by accident (really, I didn’t expect that, because she never posts on FB, but a common friend did it). That’s sent me into crying and I’ve been in an emotional down spiral ever since. I went to school this morning (I am a teacher trainee and I sat in for a lesson of my mentor’s), and as soon as I left, I was about to cry and while I sat in, I could only think of negative things. Fucking depressive thinking. I can recognize it, I made great progress in CBT, but now everything feels like a depressive relapse. I have just smoked a few cigarettes (like 5 since the bender, in social situations), compared to the 30 before I “stopped” smoking, so yeah, awesome? I’m aware of that being a good thing (I guess?), but can’t recognize it. So I have depressive symptoms again. Damn. As you can probably infer from reading this, I have quite a lot of mental fog again.

The thing is, these past few weeks when things were looking up, I felt like I was in control. I like that feeling of control. I hated it when I compulsively smoked weed, masturbate, or other detrimental habits. I dislike it so much when I am not in control of my feelings and get overwhelmed by them. Fuck depressants like weed and alcohol. (I know, the substance is not really the problem but the abuser, but still.)

I guess I’m just reassuring my own thoughts and feelings regarding numbing/drugging myself with this post. I’d love to get some input because I feel very alone and depressed right now. I don't want to start weed again.","It sounds like your inner critic is really harsh!
There is nothing wrong with you for smoking. It might be bad for you but it doesn't make you a bad person and that's an important distinction. 
Take it slow and try to gain awareness as to why and what triggers you to smoke. Like it or not you are getting something out of smoking and it's important to know what that is in order to fulfill those needs in different ways.

Anyways, I started playing again the past week or week and a half and have already tried Praxis Midrange and Dark Combrei with middling results. Then I proceeded to get destroyed by a JST version of Hero's Revenge. I couldn't really find a list on warcry and didn't try here, so I just looked through and decided to just start with a JS shell and haven't changed a card yet.


Decklist:

4 Inspire (Set1 #129)

4 Protect (Set1 #132)

2 Annihilate (Set1 #269)

4 Crownwatch Paladin (Set1 #139)

4 Piercing Grief (Set2 #143)

4 Tranquil Scholar (Set2 #76)

2 Vanquish (Set1 #143)

2 Vara's Favor (Set0 #35)

4 Bartholo, the Seducer (Set2 #234)

9 Justice Sigil (Set1 #126)

8 Shadow Sigil (Set1 #249)

4 Argenport Banner (Set2 #231)

4 Seat of Vengeance (Set0 #55)


This deck is capable of playing a solid aggressive-midrange plan when it doesn't have Hero in your opener, and then the hands where you can play a hero and protect it make most other games easy mode. 

Inspire is meant mostly as a cantrip that happens to make the top of our deck a little bit better, and can help dig towards any creatures that already had a revenge trigger go off. A card consideration has been Scheme since it digs 4 deep to help find your late game revenged creatures, but I'm personally not a fan of the cost being at 3 mana.

Protect I believe is super invaluable for this deck. Silences are the worst thing for this deck, and being to protect your Heros and other Revenge creatures from silences are really important. This is the same reasoning for cards like Crownwatch Paladin. The more ways we can give Hero Aegis, the more likely it will get out of control and run away with the game.

Valkyrie Enforcer helps gives our Hero evasion on top of the fact that the card has always been just stupidly good. 

Bartholo allows for both evasion and protection. There's literally 0 cards in the deck for his ultimate, because in all honesty if you get to 10 mana then you're flooding hardcore and have a good chance of not winning. On top of that, I'm not a believer in playing ""bad"" cards to make a good card very marginally better.

Piercing Grief is the best and worst card in the deck. When you're against either Skycrag Aggro or Burn Queen, this card is just able to gain you so much life and buy you a lot of time. It also just gives you the most bang for your buck as far as mana to battle abilities for Hero goes, especially revenge which is really nice for Hero to have in case they somehow manage to take care of it once. However, the card happens to be pretty bad in board stall situations. 

Stonepowder Alchemist surprisingly gives the deck some reach when you do reach those board stalls. You can chump block/attack with them to have them get shuffled back into your deck to potentially just draw them again and burn them out. Revenge, again, important for Hero.

Inquisitor Makto is the top end of the deck, giving Hero evasion and revenge, as well as just being a super good card to begin with.

Some common lines of play/decisions to make:

When deciding between Tranquil Scholar or Crownwatch Paladin for a turn 2 play, you generally want to lead with Paladin. Paladin lets you start getting warcry triggers off early to help buff whatever the top card of your deck is. This really only changes if you have a Hero in hand, since you want to start building up abilities for Hero.

When summoning Tranquil Scholar, if possible you want to give any other creature the ability it gains than Hero. The only ability I'd just give Hero immediately would be Aegis so that you can play it safely on turn 3.

Common Ladder Matchups:

Armory seemed to be the only consistent rough matchup. Weapons are able to fight through Aegis with ease, and Statuary Maiden renders Revenge useless. Obviously the nut games of huge unlockable Heros will still win games, but it's rough going long against it. Beware though that if they kill a creature that still has it's aegis with a weapon while Maiden is out, they'll not get the cudgel. 

Chalice is another matchup where it's rough going long, but it's a little easier to grind against it since Aegis is just so much better against this deck, and besides their silencers have no great way to dealing with revenge.

Praxis Midrange is favored, though you have to be careful since Carnosaurus can wreck your day real good.

Any Fire aggro matchup is pretty favored. You have lots of way to put on pressure quick and gain a lot of life. Rakano can be scary if they just have a bird with some big pants on it, but otherwise it's not too bad.


So this is the deck that recently got me from Diamond III to Masters in the span of about 2.5 hours after being gone from the game since basically my top 8 at an ETS a couple months ago, and I think this deck could potentially just be a tier deck. There have been some contemplating about going into a 3rd color for more potential abilities/card options but with your curve being pretty low you don't really have the best mana fixing to get all of your power undepleted the first few turns when it's important. If I ever start playing in ETS or start playing in the TCG eSports tournament that apparently started recently there's a good chance I'll play some variation of this since I think this is one of the best things you could be doing right now.","This is a fun build.

cluab1p,"Canadians are unable to do testing because of Canadian law. This enables the U.S. to monopolize the testing. 

The headline isn't inaccurate, but readers are likely to infer the U.S. is causing the problem for Canadians when it isn't.","I don't think Canada ever issued any patents in these cases... Just got stuck honouring them. 

Awarding the patents to begin with seems to me the root of all this.

c1fatro,"i have let weed consume my life the past 3 years. who ive been friends with, where ive lived, etc, etc. i'm 24 now.

i'm definitely addicted, ive tried to quit 100s of time, read all the literature on getting help, tried m/a. ive gone to many therapists, pyschiatrists, mental coaches. a lot of it has helped, but i havent been able to commit.  

when i have it i smoke it. when i dont have it, i find ways to get it. wake up and smoke 10+ times/day, and accomplish nothing.

all of my friends and family are smokers, so i dont have much for support. i moved to a new place, and i'm going to try to start fresh here. 

i can't say i wanna quit forever, because im high now, and i dont remember what not being high is even like.

anyway, finishing what i have tonight and starting tomorrow. hopefully it wont be another failed attempt. ","yeah i got the friend/family problem too. Dad says just try smoking on weekends, mum says maybe don't smoke at home/alone, then they give me pot. Most of my friends smoke, and the ones that don't live with ones that do. I like pot but i feel detached from my life and lack the motivation to change. I made six days last week.

I'm glad everything worked out! I know even though I really wanted a baby earlier (I'm 28 now), I'm so glad that things have turned out the way they have, I'm much less stressed!

dqtkzdt,"I've worked at three places.  They all pretty much do it the same.

I prefer to type my own letters, briefs, motions, and memos.  I prefer to see the sentence on the paper, and modify it as I see fit.  I don't do well trying to orally write a memo.  Plus, I type probably 50 wpm.

The standard motions and filings are all based off forms and our staff is smart enough to do those without input.  They just hand them to us to initial for approval, any changes are just scribbled on and they file them.  Since a lot of my practice is churning petitions and motions, they still do a lot of legwork, but the forms are all pretty much the same.

I think, since typing and computing have been a mainstay since elementary school, my generation and younger generations are savvy enough to be more efficient doing it yourself.  In the days before word processing and stuff, it could possibly take way too long for someone to do it themselves at a typewriter.  

I do notice an attorney who is in his late 50s in my office still types via the hunt and peck with two fingers.

He was a fantastic human being, always smiling, always there when you needed a friend. He was a police officer doing a routine traffic stop early this morning when a drunk driver hit him. He left behind a pregnant girlfriend and a beautiful little girl.

dgrl5ac,"I felt that way too until I saw the interview with Hammet where he talks about Greeny.  He is a huge fan of Green and Moore and understands the history of the guitar.

That the worst thing that could happen to Greeny was being locked away in some collectors house, never to be seen or played.  When asked about the chances of Greeny being damaged while out on the road he reminded that interviewer that Greeny had been broken many times before and that she is supposed to be played onstage.  Greeny has always been a road guitar and one more scratch or ding isn't going to change that fact.  Hammet plays Greeny at every show now and that's pretty cool.

db49sof,"Before you downvote, no this is not another complaint thread about hero balance. 

This is a thread about small little things that irk me that probably shouldn't. Keep in mind while reading this is supposed to be entertaining, not actually a real complaint thread!

* Zenyatta's animations don't line up. When he charges balls and fires, first person he pushes his hands forward, but third person he spreads his arms wide! UNPLAYABLE

* Dv.A's defense matrix seems to be activated by her OWN REFLEXES? Which would be impressive if it wasn't literally *unpossible*. It would make much more sense if it was the MEKA doing the shooting, and Dv.A is turning the field On/Off, which would further line up with how the ability resource bar works. UNREALISTIC

* Sombra, if you reload that machine pistol without emptying the magazine, there's still a round in the chamber. You don't have to pull the slide back. INEPT

* Speaking of that same gun, for being such a bleeding-edge tech hero, Sombra uses an antique of a weapon. The sight even shows how many rounds are left in HEXADECIMAL. (Honestly her reload speed could really use a boost.) WORTHLESS

* Ana's weapon is fucking terrifying, especially for someone afraid of needles. Shooting that fucking MEAT INJECTOR into someone's head would still kill them. Not to mention, how is it repairing armor? How is it rebuilding the MEKA, Bastion, Genji or Zenyatta? How is it regenerating shields?! EMBARRASSING. 

* ~~Ana also has a giant fucking turkey baster on her left forearm. For... what? She shoots the tranq out of a gun with her right arm, and throws biotic grenades with the same arm. WHAT IS IT FOR?? TO TERRIFY ME?! MEANINGLESS.~~ Turns out, that's her nano boost. I understand now.

* Hanzo and Genji are brothers and are implied to have grown up together, but have different regional accents (which also shows up in their English, but to a lesser extent, most notable Genji's consonant sounds are softer than Hanzo's). INCONSISTENT.

* Speaking of Hanzo/Genji, on Hanamura they show the arrow in the ground, shurikens on the wall and some light damage to the dojo from the ""Dragons"" animated short. BUT, there is no arrow cut in half on the wall of the balcony. LAZY.

* The cars traveling on Oasis are traveling much too fast for the road they're on, which isn't wide enough for two lanes in the first place. Furthermore, unless there is some technology which negates the inertia inside these vehicles, the passengers are likely dead. DISGUSTING. 

* Pharah's suit doesn't account for the jets being mounted offset her center of gravity! In reality, she would pitch forward, or do infinite somersaults! (Also, her suit really should let her use the boost in any direction she's looking or moving, but that's just my opinion, man. I think it'd help her from being so easily countered by hitscan) LITERALLY UNUSABLE. 

* ""How do we make an antiquated revolver, even by today's standards, look cool and futuristic?""
""I dunno, give it glowing bits and make the rounds glow too""
-UNINSPIRED BLIZZARD DEVS, PROBABLY

* Ana or Mercy probably gave 76 a self injector heal gadget that would rapidly heal him much like Gasmask Fatass. But he's too old to give a shit about learning how to use newfangled gadgets and just smashes it on the ground. Mercy/Ana are probably just too nice to tell him he's using (DESTROYING) it incorrectly. INCOMPETENT. 

* Widow ""The real edge lord"" Maker's heart is slowed down to be a better sniper or whatever and it turned her skin blue. Whatever. HOW does she do LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE? Running? Out of the question. Adrenaline? NO. Also, emotions are much more brain chemicals than blood. She'd still feel emotions, they'd just be delayed. Also they'd last longer. Widow ""I'm still sad I overcooked my eggs this morning"" Maker should be miles behind everyone in emotional timelines. AMATEURISH. 

* Reinhardt's helmet makes his head smaller. INFURIATING. 

* Lucio heals you and makes your ass fast with the sound of sweet and spicy beats. THAT YOU HAVE TO BE IN LINE OF SIGHT TO HEAR APPARENTLY.

* (Edit!) How does Meka even work?! Do the sticks control walking or aim? When Dva walks forward, she pushes the control sticks, and when straffing or walking back, she moves them side to side, and pulls them respectively. But, when she punches, she moves the stick in a jerking fashion like she's controlling the arm. BUT BUT When she does hello emote, she waves, and the Meka arm waves in unison. BUT BUT BUT, when she flies, she pushes the sticks together and controls the meka like a bike. WHICH IS IT?!

I do hope Blizzard fixes this embarrassing excuse for a game in the near future. Honestly I'm surprised they thought we wouldn't notice these completely unacceptable mistakes. 

What other INCOMPETENCIES have you noticed?","How the fuck do Handsoap's arrows do anything at all to armored targets like Bastion, D.Va and Rein? I don't care what the arrows are made of the velocity isn't enough to do anything useful.

UNPLAYABLE ",,,

c7oxruz,"Just a tip, should you ever have offspring of your own who pull similar shenanigans: use Dawn dish soap. Whenever there is any kind of oily substance introduced to the hair, and normal shampoo doesn't seem to rinse it out, use a bit of Dawn. Lather it well, then rinse it and follow up with conditioner. It should  do the job on the first wash, but it will leave your hair feeling dry, so make sure to be generous with conditioner.

When I was 14, I had the unfortunate experience of having an idiot who didn't know her way around stage makeup put a huge amount of molding putty in my hair to make a prosthetic injury--she assured me (despite my objections) that it would come right out. When it didn't, she told me to use baby oil on it. Well, I was eventually able to work it out with a metric fuck ton of baby oil, but then had the greasiest hair EVER. No matter how much I washed it with shampoo, it stayed greasy and lank. The next day, at church, a woman imparted the Dawn dish soap wisdom to me. No idea why she knew it would work on greasy hair, I didn't ask. But I went home and lathered up, and it took the grease right out. ",thank you for the tip!

c8v17yg,"Hey guys, occasional poster here and I just wanted to say how much I love r/poppunkers! One thing I've noticed over the years is that people who really like pop-punk tend to be extremely loyal to the genre and other fans of the genre. What makes this genre so special for you guys? 

For me, I grew up listening to bands like blink-182, Green Day, Sum 41, the classics at this point. When I grew interested in guitar however I moved toward metal and hardcore for years. It was only in the middle of high school that I was drawn to the sounds of Taking Back Sunday and Brand New which led me further into the genre. 

 It's the new school of pop-punk with bands like Transit, The Wonder Years, Set Your Goals, that gets me through the day. I always felt that kids who feel alone, even when they aren't, are drawn to pop-punk. The combination of meaningful lyrics with upbeat and punk-influenced was perfect for me.

Pop-punk to me is the time I spent with my friends, driving around and listening to the bands I loved with people I love. Pop-punk is all the concerts I went to with fifteen people there, but every single one was always screaming the lyrics to every song. Pop-punk is happiness.


Anytime at all, you feel like you're falling down
Just look up and realize
How small we really are
-Rule of Nines, Transit

What does it mean to you guys?",I just love how the bands are so into their music. They don't give a shit if people don't like them. They don't give a shit if they get rich doing it. They just love to jam with their friends and want other people to jam with them and relate to them so everyone knows they're not alone. As a girl it makes me realize I can be shitty sometimes.

**Doctors Notes**

Amanda continues to reject the therapy. Her delusions have gotten much worse and she has become violent. I am requesting that she be transferred to Doctor Derek Hunt who has more experience in dealing with violent patients.

**Good Story**

Awesome job with the story man, I'm really enjoying it. I know you don't typically respond to people on here, but if you could just respond to me, I'd appreciate it. There has been some strange occurances this past month that coincide with when I started reading your stories. There has 2 attempted break in's at around 4 am and my daughter keeps telling me that she's seeing a woman in our yard. I know it's a probably a huge coincidence, but if you could just ease my mind a bit, I'd appreciate it. Thanks and keep it up!

**You Crazy Bastard**

Dude, I love you. This shit is really hitting close to home though. My girlfriend mentioned in passing that there was an elderly woman on our porch last night. There is a good chance she's fucking with me since my laptop has your stories bookmarked and she probably just stumbled on it. In any case, I'm scared shitless and I love you for that. I can't remember the last time a story on nosleep kept me up at night.

**Amazing Story Yields an Important Question**

I will admit to feeling a rush of excitement whenever I see that you have put a new post up. The longevity and ongoing superb storytelling that your posts hold is amazing. But I have to ask if there may be some truth to this story. Sparked by curiousity the other night, I decided to do some research on Hell House, and found that much of the information in your stories is accurate. While researching, though, I looked up and could have sworn that I had seen a person standing in my backyard, which was unusual for a number of reasons; first off, it was near three in the morning, and most people in my town are asleep by then, second, my backyard is completely fenced in, by a 7 foot fence, mind you, so that makes it more strange that someone may have been back there. Naturally, I looked the fuck away and stared intently at my computer screen until I felt safe enough to flee to my bed and cower under the blankets. This could have been just a coincidence, but I would still like to know if your stories are just that, stories, or if they're legit.

ckbet3x,"Hello internet! 

I am a guy, a human guy to be more precise, currently located in the United States, in some part of it. I was born 8,960 days ago, making me 24 years old. I adore socializing, but the way life is right now I do not have any close interpersonal relationships. I do my best to be modest, always try to stay humble, and I believe not believing in a higher power helps me more accurately know my place in the world, and what a glorious place it is. My favorite human beings are all reddit idols, probably because that's where I discovered them, but I love people like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Mitch Hedberg and Stephen Fry. They all 3 share qualities I admire, attributes that I see in myself at a lesser degree- those being: science-loving, comedic, and linguistic. Stephen Fry also happens to be bipolar, and I am that as well. 

My talents always fell into the ""words"" category. Anything from poetry, vocabulary, and most recently other languages, I've always seen beauty in words. Thinking about the evolution of language really fascinates me, or the evolution of anything for that matter. :)

The loneliness I experience can get pretty bad, I handle it well but my coping mechanism is what I am doing right this moment... look for fiends online. I keep my phone around me 95% of the time, I very dearly wish I had a friend on speed dial I could text (or message) on a night like tonight and get a response back when they see it. I worry too much about whether people like me or not.

dj0krh1,"So, my partner of 6 years has always had her quirks.
At first she wanted to know my every move, even to the point where she tracked my phone if she didn't believe me (never gave her any reason not to).
She took control of the finances, by force - transferring my monthly salary into her account, which has now become a regular thing. Any sort of discussion as to what she's doing with the money or what's going on with money results in an argument 100% of the time. I have not touched physical money in over 3 years, even money out in cards from my parents is taken from me. 
I am constantly accused of:

* Smoking

* Drinking

* Cheating

* Deleting text messages

* Seeing other people

* Trying to leave her

* Avoiding her

* Etc,

None of the above is true, I've been loyal for  every second of our relationship. She's an overly confident person, but whenever she accuses me of things she comes across as frail, weak and vulnerable (not sure how she does this while screaming at me, but she manages it).

I am completely unable to voice my opinions in any way, even if I do manage to finish a sentence without being spoken over, interrupted or told ""no"" instantly, they seem to be completely ignored and in some instances she will do the complete opposite.

She holds the fact we have a child together against me. My daughter is used as a weapon against me so that I won't even consider leaving, which I can barely fathom. I am permanently undermined when it comes to raising my daughter, if I say no - she says yes and relishes is doing so.

I am made to clean up after her, she will actively open something and drop the packaging on the floor - and gesture for me to pick it up. I cook, I clean, I do her laundry. I also work a full time job, which occasionally means working from home during the evening/day. 
I pay for fitness classes and other recreational activities (don't really have a choice - she's got all the money), which chime to the value of around £300 p/m, yet I can go around 5/6 months without getting a haircut (roughly &lt;£10).

Yesterday, I wore clothes that were definitely overdue - majority of my clothes have holes in and I haven't managed to buy anything new in years (she has new clothes near enough every week and guilts me into giving her permission to buy them). As soon as I was home from work, I was berated for working a t-shirt, (cost around £6, if that) - saying that it wasn't for every day wear, and that I'd ignored her. She spent the entire night guilting me over wearing a shirt, spent hours just arguing with me - even after me apologising profusely for over an hour.

I don't really know what to do any more. 
I've been offered a once in a lifetime trip away with work to Asia, to liaise with clients - she's flat out told me I can't go. *(She does this alot, I haven't been to a 'work night out' or Christmas party [family or work] since we've been together).*
She's isolated me from my family, I see my parents once every 3 months? If that.
I am not allowed friends, she has the passwords to my accounts for everything. She's even told me to sleep at work once  or twice when I've irritated  her. She goes through my phone, including my work phone - which she also accused me of deleting messages from my boss, which is ridiculous - she's a married woman, 15 years my senior, with 2 kids and there is absolutely no attraction.

I am at a complete loss. Is this emotional abuse? Or am I just I'm a complex relationship? I can't see how I'm constantly wrong. Obviously, after yesterday I'm starting to think there's something wrong with the dynamics - 6 hours in silence for wearing a t-shirt seems a little excessive (*oh while I got that shirt, she spent over £250 on clothes/shoes*).

Obviously it's difficult because we have a child - but should I really be subjecting myself to this constantly? 
My self worth has diminished, I'm always put down over having gained a little weight, told that I'm not attractive any more. I'm not even allowed to tell anyone about any of this - last time she didn't speak to me for a week. So I've come to you, Reddit - what should I do?

cs2gpfh,"I have a flair for telling stories so please forgive the length. 

I grew up like most of us where I was constantly warned about the threats of the world. I was told all your standard red flags and even trained in martial arts for a majority of my life. Hell, I didn't just feel prepared, I felt confident. But, as a 15 year old girl, I of course thought I knew more than I really did. 

My Sophmore year of high school I got a part time job with my best friend Alek. Alek and I were hired at a local Elemetary school to be counselors in the after school program. Basically we just had to watch kids all day and try to keep them from killing themselves.

Months went by and I loved the job. I've always been great with kids and Alek and I both had very childish natures and the kids loved that about us. We were always playing games with them and getting crayon drawings depicted how much they loved us. I became instantly protective of these tiny people. 

Alek and I had one other girl our age, a tiny black girl named Maria, who rarely talked and often looked angry or constantly irritated by all the kids. I honestly didn't talk to her much and I could see the kids went out of their way to avoid her too. But the second things started getting out of control her booming voice would echo above the chaos and everyone (even Alek and I) would promptly shut the fuck up. 

The adults at this elementary school were shockingly never present. I would see them when I showed up but it was like they promptly noped the fuck out when we got there. Looking back, I  really should have told someone but at the time, I didn't fully comprehend how neglectful they were. The head lady and a few others were actually arrested later for embezzeling money a few years after I quit. All this to say, we needed a strong voice like Maria.

We always let the kids out to play on sunny days and this week had been beautiful. It wasnt yet schorching like Georgia weather could often be. During this week, I had noticed something strange. 

There were woods surrounding our playground and on the other side of the woods was a subdivision. It wasn't weird to see people or families hiking through the woods near the playground. 

During this week though I had noticed a continued appearance of one older looking man. White, seemingly in his 50's, bald, 5'8 and probably about 160-70 lbs, always dressed in stained clothes. 

How he walked was what set me on edge. He would saunter through the woods incredibly slowly, almost like he was sneaking like a develish cartoon character and never taking his eyes of the children. I nudged Alek and we watched him but every day he would come close but never actually getting to the playground.

Again, looking back, I wish I had told someone but honestly I felt like no one at the school cared. But I felt confident in my stupid teenage head. I knew I could protect these kids.

Until one warm Friday when I was playing duck duck goose with the little ones. I saw him out of the corner of my eye. He was at the tree line, very close to playground. I spun around in time to see him talking to one of the little girls who he had managed to coax to the woodline next to him. 

I shot up as did Alek when he realized my panic. I saw him reach for the girls hand while she kept snatching it back, slowly backing away from him. Gradually, he was working his way forward, getting more and more agressive. Pulling at her hand then trying to slam his hands down on her shoulders.

Sirens were wailing in my head but panic had set it. My blood felt like it had frozen in its veins. I was motionless just watching this scene happen. I was scrambling to form a single cohert thought to move but those mesely 5-10 seconds felt like an enternity. That's when we all heard it.

""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!"" Everyone on the playground froze. The man's head snapped up. 

Maria shot up from her seat on the side of the playground. Storming toward the man. She suddenly seemed much taller than her 5'3 self. 

""IF YOU DON'T TURN AROUND AND RUN THE FUCK AWAY FROM HERE RIGHT NOW I WILL BUST YOUR ASS ALL OVER THIS YARD MOTHERFUCKER"" 

There was a nano second of stunned silence.  Of all things, My muddled brain was shocked she just said those words in front of kids. The man turned and stumbled over himself as he sprinted into the woods. She ordered everyone inside and no one said a peep as she directed us to the cafeteria and put cartoons on the TV. I felt like an 8 year old shuffling along with them. Ill never forget sittng down to ""The Proud Family"" and having a couple of the girls crawl into my lap with the same look of confusion I felt.

Now, almost 12 years later, I look back on that situation, so proud and releaved that Maria did what I couldn't do. I try not to be hard on myself since I was only a kid but I still mentally kick myself sometimes when I think about it. Thankfully, it was a huge learning experience. 

So weird woods-man, LETS MEET. I'd love to deliver Maria's promise for trying to potentially hurt one of my kids. 

","Wow. When the story began I thought Maria was going to do something crazy, but by the end she was my hero!",,,
cqt541x,"Recently, my Lodge took in a petition from a man with a questionable past.  He freely admitted to the fact that he has a felony conviction  for violent crime, approximately five years ago.  The Master appointed himself, the SW, and me (due to my career in law enforcement) to the investigating committee.  The investigating committee met with the petitioner for two hours, and all three of us are in agreement, he should be given an opportunity, when he comes off probation (potentially, in July).

I've been able to track down information regarding his criminal act.  He was involved with a criminal motorcycle gang.  His role seemed to be minor, but he was directly involved.  He plead guilty, cooperated with police against his co-defendants, and he's been a good man for the past five years.  He has never failed a drug test while on probation.  He has gotten married, had a family, and begun volunteering in the community (on his own, not court-ordered).  I've spoken with his probation officer, and she seems to think ""positive male role models"" would be good for him.

Here's my trouble.  Several Lodge members have approached me and told me, confidentially, they are not comfortable with the situation, and I'm inclined to believe he won't pass the ballot.  At what point does a candidate's past prevent him from seeking the Degrees?  Can a petitioner with a dark past redeem himself enough to join our Brotherhood?","Thanks to all.

czjh8bt,"Hi guys! So my store recently got restauranteur. I've been with the store for about two years and saw my gm go through the struggle of themes, getting rid of 70% of his old crew and training a brand new crew to be restaurateur.

So to be put on the now list, there was a panel of people.
Monty, Gretchen, my field leader and someone else, who I forgot.

To get restauranteur was just Monty

Someone recently asked me if I remembered Montys interview questions and I do. So I thought I would make a post on it.

*disclaimer-don't fake your feelings just to get restaurateur, if your store genuinely doesn't feel this, youre not going to get it because the vibe isn't there and honestly, you dont deserve it*




So I'm sure you know that to even get a visit, you need to have 0 themes, a well organized, constantly detailed clean store and cut sizes on point.




But restauranteur is about creating a people culture, so a lot of Montys questions revolve feelings.




**Why am I here at your store today?**

The key to this answer is confidence, so you'd answer 
""So we can show you we're restauranteur"" or even joke around ""to show you how awesome we are!""
Not a shaky answer like ""to see if we're ready to be restauranteur"" or ""so you can validate us""

**Tell me about your relationship with your gm.**
**Do you feel like your gm cares about you? **
**How does he show it? **
**Give me an example of a time he's made you feel loved or cared  for.**
**Tell me a story personal to you and your gm**
**

These are obviously subjective. We focused on feeling loved and cared for.




**A top performer needed two things-what are they?**

There is only one correct answer-
Performing consistent excellent work and making people better 

**How long before a new hire is considered a top performer?**

About a month


**What does empowerment mean to you?**
Empowerment is a feeling. It's going into work and knowing you're gonna have a fun day at work. It's knowing that I'm cared for, my gm cares about my opinion, and he loves me and want the best for me in and outside of chipotle.


**How does your gm empower you?**
I personally have examples.

For example:
Once my boss scheduled me to close grill on Sunday and I had a big test Monday morning. He didn't know I had the test but when he asked me how school was going and I told him about the test, he sent me home early so I could study and get a good night sleep. He personally closed grill that night. 


**What's he's vision?**

I really hope I don't have to tell you your gms vision. 


**What's your role in his vision?**
To be a top performer, make people better. 


**If you had to put a monetary price on how much you're worth to your gm, how much would you be?**

There's only one right answer: 
10,000. That's how much of a bonus your gm gets if you become a gm.


**Could your gm be restauranteur without you?**

Most people say yes but the actual correct answer that they'll looking for is no. You are a pivotal part of why your gm is restauranteur, he couldn't have done it without you.  


**What happens after you get restauranteur?**

There is only one correct answer:

We maintain our standards and help make future leaders 


**What's your gms new goal once he achieves restauranteur?**
There is only one correct answer:

Help other stores become R's and create future leaders


**Is your apprentice ready to be a gm?**

Only you can answer this 


**How do your managers lead through empowerment?**

Again I gave examples. 


That's pretty much it except one thing- my field leader told me that they might ask questions to the grill people regarding usage per thousand, critical points aka KM stuff. He didn't, but study up on that too. ","What were your answers to these questions?
How long was the visit?
Was the store operating during normal hours?
Do you get a raise because your store is restauranteur? 
What's your region? ",,,

c6pt7g0,"I'm a 27 year old, 6'1, 195 LBS, male @ about 13%-15% body fat

I've been going to the gym 3 days a week for the past 8 months and I run 3-6 miles two days a week. 

My main goal is strength increase which has grown. My secondary goal is body image I want more definition and just a little bit more muscle mass.

No injuries or disorders besides a torn ligament in my ankle that has been repaired. Due to the injury my flexibility when squatting in a little bit hindered I can only do 3/4 - 7/8 squats before losing balance but I squat 405lbs so its to much of a hindrance and doesn’t really have to do with my question.

I defiantly hit all my macros and micros I eat really clean I do drink a bit on the weekends however. I take whey and casein protein, fish oil, creatine, and Vit-D for supplements...

I am having a problem with defining my Pectoral muscles I bench 225 LBS I do flat barbell bench press, Incline bench press, dips, and fly’s. I do 3 sets of 5 for every exercise. For some reason I can increase my weight with no problem each week however I’m not getting any really noticeable body transformation with my Pecs.

dr0zu01,"First I want to thank everyone who replied to my original post.
I'm severely panicking that I've ruined my life https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7iik8k/im_severely_panicking_that_ive_ruined_my_life/?st=JB02OMJO&amp;sh=d61bd781

I couldn't reach out to everyone individually, I was kind of letting the responses sink in. I never thought I would get so much help, and for that I really thank you all.

When I saw that 99% of the replies said the same thing, I panicked. I wanted someone to tell me that I'm being irrational and that it will all get better after the wedding, that I just had cold feet. 
I told my finance that we had to talk and told her it couldn't wait until after the rehearsal dinner. She told me that we can't be late, and I begged her to talk to me. I told her how I was feeling, and I was begging her to reassure me that she will help me, that she'll help us get back to who we were when we first met. I desperately told her I wanted to save our future marriage. She told me I'm being ridiculous and that I was ""banned"" (her exact words) from going to the rehearsal dinner with my silly emotional state.
I stayed in my room, and cried. There was a lot of back story I didn't share on my first post. My parents are friends with her parents, and our fathers belong to the same invitation only club. (Golfing) 
I knew my dad wouldn't have my back. And I know so many of you said to confront him and tell him. So I did, after the rehearsal was over and everyone went to bed I spoke to him and my mom. And they dismissed me pretty much. Told me we can benefit from marriage counseling but that it isn't a reason to cancel a wedding the night before. They promised me help after we get back from the honeymoon.
So, morning rolls in. And I wake up at quarter to 7. Wedding ceremony starts at 10. I tell my best man that I'm not doing it. I tell him what's going on. (He's known about the sexless part for a while but not to this extent) I told him to tell my groomsmen and everyone else. I didn't want to deal with that, one of the groomsmen is her brother and would cause issues. He's not a close friend, but she wanted him in the party.
I wanted to tell the pastor but I honestly didn't even know where to find the guy or reach him. I haven't really been allowed to do much in the planning of this wedding, just know what to say and where to show up.
So I wrote a note on those hotel note pads they have on the nightstand. I just wrote that since I'm still in my silly emotional state, I'm ""banning"" myself from the wedding. And that I'm going back to the apartment to collect my things. I told her to enjoy her wedding, and that she should definitely go and enjoy the honeymoon since all expenses were covered by me.
So now I'm just on my layover. A couple more hours until I'm back to where I use to call home. I pay the rent, but I called my landlord and paid an additional 2 months so she can figure things out. I'll be taking my most essential stuff as quickly as I can and then will be crashing at my best friends (best man) apartment. I'm then booking myself 2 weeks vacation to Hawaii. I don't even want to be in this state when everyone gets back. Nor do I have the power to deal with it right now.

Thank you everyone. Seriously, thank you for helping me make such a hard decision. I know how I left seems cowardly, but knowing my family and hers, it was the easiest for me at the moment. I know I have to face them at some point, but for now I need to get my peace back.

Also, the amount of missed calls I've gotten from her, and a bunch of other people is scary.

Edit- thank you so much to everyone who posted, I'm trying to reply as much as I can, I'm back home now and quickly packing up my important belongings, so it may take a while for me to respond.

Edit- I wanted to take a minute and talk a little bit about my parents since I've gotten a lot of DMs asking about the situation. I didn't include this in the original post because I didn't think it was important to mention, and that I didn't want to seem like I was bragging about money.

My parents are wealthy, and have a high social standing. I grew up in this life style, and have always done my best to make them proud. 
I was in a relationship before my ex fiancé that my parents didn't approve of at all. (She wasn't from a rich family and was too rough around the edges for them, and she had a tattoo) Anyway, they always did everything in their power to have me end it. They made her feel terrible, they made me feel terrible. 
I'm ashamed to admit that I left that girl eventually after my parents introduced me to my ex fiancé. Her family is friends with mine and belong to the same country club. 
It's a mistake that my dumb young mind back then couldn't comprehend. They convinced me I didn't love her, and I guess I saw the shiny new toy in front of me and caved. I wanted to make them happy so bad.
So, that's why when everyone was telling me to go to my parents about this, I knew that I wouldn't get the support. And I know that I'm going to be blamed for this, there's no reasoning or explaining it away. My parents are rational people or kind for that matter.
I still think of my old ex to this day. She was an amazing girl, I wonder what would of happened if I was strong enough back then to have said no.",You did the right thing. I hope you have a great time in Hawaii!,,,

ctfnlxq,"Yeah, I guess my question is whether or not Pledis was actually turning a profit four years ago when they decided to put another group together. How about three years ago? What about two? If they don't have the money to promote existing groups, they shouldn't have made the decision to train people for a 13 member boy group - and unless I'm very mistaken (and I could well be), they haven't been making any kind of notable profit in quite awhile.

After School has a decent fanbase that would have been bigger had they been able to promote more instead of basically disappearing for long stretches at a time. They also dropped the ball when it comes to Nu'est, who had a great debut and could have been incredibly popular. If they can't properly manage their existing acts, they shouldn't add even more people to mismanage. 

I like Seventeen. I enjoyed their promotions. It's not that I blame the group for the company's mistakes - I don't. I just don't understand what the fuck Pledis are even doing right now. They had at least two very marketable, solid groups that they should have been promoting the fuck out of, and instead they decided to put all of their eggs in a new basket while shoving everyone else to the back. 

If they would actually spend the money, time, and effort on comebacks for AS or Nu'est, I guarantee that the fans would come back. Especially AS with Lizzy and Nana, and the success of Orange Caramel? There would absolutely be fans supporting them. 

This is just all so shitty. I hate seeing great groups that are essentially wasted, and I'm concerned for Seventeen, honestly. Like I said, I really enjoyed their debut - they seem like a great group. So did AS and Nu'est. I don't trust that Pledis will be able to successfully manage them, as their track record is pretty terrible. And the stress that the guys must be under right now, essentially working to save the entire freaking company. =/ ","Yes you're right. If they're in debt now, were they having trouble years ago? And you're right. Pledis might even screw over seventeen even though they're the breadwinners now. ",,,

Where the schedule differs is in the other AFC teams we play. Because we finished third we get the Bengals and colts while the chiefs get Pitt and Texans, raiders get ravens and Titans. I'd say that makes the broncos schedule easier based on the first two weeks.

Using pure records from 2016 is akin to saying the broncos have a harder schedule than the raiders cause the raiders don't have to play the raiders","Or I can just look at the schedule and make a decision that just so happens to be the same as ESPN, Bleacher Report and FS1 and you can just be okay with that and everyone can just move on with their lives and realize it's not that big of a deal and you don't need to continue messaging me.

ci6kbh0,"On Tuesday, May 20th I woke up at 3 am to go pee and realized my underwear were really wet. At first I thought maybe I had peed a little, but after peeing and changing my underwear another little gush of fluid came out and I realized it was my water. FYI, amniotic fluid smells like a sweeter version of semen, in case you were wondering! I had been having lots of pre-labor cramping and contractions for the past week, so I assumed contractions would start on their own fairly quickly. I woke my SO and told him my water broke, but that I was going to try to sleep for at least a few more hours. We had planned on laboring at home with our doula until contractions were 4 minutes apart, and a minute each for an hour before heading to the hospital, so we were in no rush to get going. The plan was for a drug free birth, and we knew delaying going to the hospital would make this more likely to happen. I fell back asleep until about 6 am, and then got up to call my mom to let her know my water had broken. Still no contractions... 

My parents got to our house around 9 am and I had already talked to my doula. She was going to come over when contractions were about 10 minutes apart. But contractions still had not started. Thus began a long period of waiting and trying lots of methods to get labor to start. Finally at around 5 pm I started getting some real contractions about 10 minutes apart and lasting about a minute. Unfortunately after about 2 hours these tapered off too. At this point I knew we would just have to head to the hospital. I knew the hospital didn't want you to go over 24 hours with your water broken without a baby. I know that the risks of infection are tiny without any type of vaginal penetration once your water breaks, so I wasn't overly concerned about my water being broken for awhile, but this is the hospital policy and I really wanted to avoid a c-section. 

Once we got to the hospital they called my doctor (who I love, and was totally on board with our drug free birth plan), and she told me that I had no choice but to start pitocin. I was disappointed, but knew when we headed to the hospital that would be inevitable. At this point I was dilated to a 2 1/2, 90% effaced. 

They started the pitocin at midnight, and I slept until about 3:30 am. At that point I had a few decent contractions, but was able to breath through them easily enough. The nurse checked me, and I was now at 4 cm. I got up and went to the bathroom. I had been constipated for the past couple days, and felt like I could finally poop! While I was in the bathroom I had a couple really strong contractions, but I pooped, yay!  After going to the bathroom everything became REALLY intense. I started having 60 to 90 second contractions 2 minutes apart (which literally means you only sometimes have 30 seconds between them). It felt like I was getting hit by a train every time they rolled through. The only position I could even remotely get through them was standing, leaning on my SO, and moaning. I threw up, and then I realized there was no way I could do this for the next 6 cm, and still have energy to push. I was shaking uncontrollably and felt completely overwhelmed, so I ended up asking the nurse for an epidural. The anesthesiologist was there within 10 minutes, and quickly got it placed. I actually still had full control over my legs even. The nurse checked me again and I was 9 1/2 cm dilated, 100% effaced. Ha, when she told us that I said ""Are you fucking with me?!"" We now realize I was in transition labor and that's why it was soo intense. I dilated from a 4 to a 9 in a little over an hour. I also now know that I could have done it without an epidural, since the worst was basically over by the time I got it, but since I didn't know that at the time I can't really regret it. 

She had me practice push, and that went really well. After 6 pushing contractions we could see the top of a very hairy head. :) The nurse asked if I wanted my doctor to deliver, as she only lives 10 minutes from the hospital, and at the time I thought that sounded great, so I said yes. Holy crap, was that a mistake! Since my LO was so far down my body took over and the urge to push during contractions was absolutely overwhelming. The nurses literally put me on my side, with my legs together during contractions to hold the baby in. The urge to push was the most visceral feeling I have ever experienced, and your body also just starts to push that baby out, even though the nurses kept telling me not to push. The doctor arrived just in time to catch the baby, as it was coming out whether they wanted it to or not! 

We hadn't found out the sex, so as they did the delayed cord clamping my SO whispered to me that it was a boy. When they put him on my chest for the first time it was the most emotional experience of my life. I'm still not sure whether I was laughing or crying (probably both).

* All votes should be submitted via the comment box and never as a reply to somebody else's votes
* REVISED TIEBREAKER RULE: If, after the 24-hour deadline, two songs are tied, the votes for both songs will be reset to 0, and the match-up will be repeated in the next day's set of votes to determine the winner after another 24 hours.
* Any remix or alternate version spawned from any of the songs listed is a valid option when voting; it is still the same song, just arranged differently!
* This is obvious, but christ, don't use multiple accounts to vote lol that is so cheap

cljjntj,"*thats niice man! one year ago i was 18 too and had a dead end job as a waiter, feeling depressed and all alone and didnt knew what to do with my life.

*Now im in a kinda better job with a opportunity to raise, feeling good and positive ( since i started visiting this subreddit) and finally saw that im not alone in this journey, that i have a lot of good friends that cheer me up, keep me strong and help me to chase my dream.

*The way you see your life is the way you gonna live it, change your view about things and your life will change with it.

deygzww,We have a bunch of new members so I wanted to welcome everyone and let you know this is a weekly post where we provide an update on what is happening in our dating lives.,"Hi everyone. New here. So yesterday was Pi day. So, I stop by Friday's restaurant for some pie. During Happy Hour. I'm alone in the Bar. I see two ladies having a beer. I order them each one shot of Blowjob Cocktail. To break the ice. It worked. I get to meet and chat with them for an hour. Give one of them my phone number. :) ",,,
dfxyhon,"I think you have to loot them, which by default, should be shift+L.","Nice! That worked. Or at least, I got the loot flag to show over them (edit: and they picked them up). The items didn't have the loot icon on them so it was confusing.  Also the looting hotkey is great to have, I'm so sick of clicking on them individually...

But I suppose the bug report that I have for any devs reading this, is that dropped items from downed hearthlings don't show that they're a lootable item.",,,
cctqous,Silent House. Don't watch it in the dark.,"Best watching at night for the full effect.

crfs6w6,"This interview is a bit older than those ""rumours"". It's a good interview though.","I could be wrong, but it appears that they are citing [Kalle's interview with SZ](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/bayern-vorstand-rummenigge-im-interview-ich-registriere-einen-gewissen-anti-guardiola-trend-1.2481447) which took place on May 17th.

cjn9bmm,"Today I am having some really bad cravings due to depression. 

I keep thinking of a recently failed relationship. There was a glimmer of hope that we might get back together, but some recent communications make it seem extremely unlikely. It is sinking in that I have probably lost someone that I loved (and still love). This person has been a huge part of my life for over 10 years and I can't imagine a life without her.

This depression I am having today also makes me extremely negative and I keep envisaging the worst case scenarios for my future (beyond just relationships). There is a distinct feeling of hopelessness and I feel like everything in my life is turning to shit (and will always be shit). 

I'm really fighting the urge to just say ""fuck it"" and give in to my raging animal desire to have a cigarette. 

Sorry to be a downer, I was feeling so strong yesterday and now....well....sigh.

I'm going for a run and some exercise. I hope that helps. ","In addition, I'd say go on a date. With anyone. No pressure, just get back up on the horse. 

When I got in a car accident 10 days after getting my license, I thought my folks were going to kill me. They didn't, but the first thing they did the next day was force me to drive one of their cars. Don't be afraid it will eat away at you. It's one of the best lessons they taught me. ",,,

czf0z0h,"Hey everyone, I just started counting calories and I noticed it's hard as hell to get enough protein. I'm 185 lbs roughly, and every time I eat a meal it'll be like say 600 calories but only 30 grams of protein. My protein shake is just 26 grams of protein at 150 calories, I feel like if I actually eat enough protein, it'll go well over my TDEE - 500 calories.

So I just wanted to know what some of you guys eat in order to actually get enough protein.

EDIT : I'm seeing so many replies, thank you for all the tips and suggestions and meals that you guys are giving. ","Jennie o extra lean ground turkey.

Find a park with a hill, buy a $150 kit that includes RX/TX, and you will be hooked :)",I used to play soccer before I got fat. I could take up that. Or I could take Zumba classes at my local gym.

divj7th,"To answer my own question: 

Tarte- overall favorite brand. Aesthetic matches mine, especially the rainforest of the sea collection. The eyeshadows are to my liking, don't need primer but primer improves them. The palettes all make sense to me, and can create cohesive, attractive looks I can wear in any situation. After all these years, I've found a HG concealer and mascara. 

Bite beauty- all the lipsticks I've tried from them have been pleasing. I do declutter the shades that don't work for me that I've gotten over time, but I don't dislike any of the formulas on my lips. The packaging is sleek and the tubes a strange texture I can quite describe. 

I was going to say lipstick queen, but they only beat out bite beauty in their packing, I prefer bites formula. I don't really guess I have a third brand. ",The first brand that came to mind for me was Bite for all the reasons you mentioned. I'm so obsessed with their stuff. ,,,
dhrfyg8,[Dad? Dad? Dad?](http://imgur.com/a/lePeo),"This has some kind of perspective optical illusion going on with it that makes it kinda crazy to look at. I like that. It's the way the kid's hands grip the rail, it would be physically impossible for him to hang like that.",,,
d6n91lo,"Actuary here (I'm the guy who tells insurance companies to charge by gender).

Insurance companies can't charge by race. That's frowned upon and is illegal in pretty much every jurisdiction that I've worked in (at least in the US).

They charge by gender because it's correlated with loss (and like others have said, because it's not illegal), for certain kinds of insurance like car insurance. In auto, males tend to suffer more losses than females, and hence tend to pay more.

Lastly, you CAN sue. Go ahead! Get a lawyer and file a lawsuit. If you're able to hire a particularly powerful lawyer, you might be able to abolish price discrimination by gender. It won't have any impact on my employment prospects, so I encourage you to take action for what you believe is right if that is what you wish.",Would this work for colleges? Suing colleges for admitting based on race/gender?,,,
dak5t4u,"Hi, just started scratch start tig welding (can mig and stick) using a kemppi mini arc evo 180. I seem to have to hold a ridiculously close arc for it not to go out, I'm running 120amp just trying to pad beads on 10mm mild steel I've cleaned all the material before hand and am using 2.3mm 2% ceriated tungsten. Any tips would be much appreciated. ","How does the machine weld when you're stick welding? Try it with an electrode that runs on DC straight polarity like E6013.

ddkisk7,"Yeah like basically whenever I am familiar with people I like (romantically or as a friend), and they go to pee, I usually ask them ""Can I listen in?"" or ""Can I watch?"" 

I even got a bunch of audios of my ex(es) peeing noises, and vice versa (one had a peeing phobia but eventually he got over it because of me).

Basically it's an intimate or very personal thing (at least to me). Not everybody hears you pee because it's something you usually do alone. Or some people are just creeped or grossed out because hey, it's a fluid waste.  

Personally also the feeling of peeing feels good, especially when the bladder is bursting. Combine it when feeling aroused, and peeing feels even nicer. 

But note that I'm quite into off-beat things, so of course being open to piss is on the list. 

I also see piss as a very normal thing and with some friends (or open-minded romantic partners) I would normalize the whole ""Can I listen in?"" (They'd listen in to me or I'd listen in to them, or we'd still have a chat whilst doing it or try to distract or arouse each other for laughs.)

Some people I've met also like some ideas of degradation, so it involves being pissed on or being used as a toilet. I once knew a guy that was into femdom, bdsm, face sitting and being peed on (on him or in him/his mouth) for example. 

But I do need to mention that in a lot of professional pee porn videos they just drink a lot of water to make a clearer, cleaner pee so that it's less gross and that they'd have plenty of pee to perform. When the pee is clear or light-colored, that's when you're all good. 

For me, I like pissing, and I'm not sure where to begin to answer. It feels good, it's not necessarily sexual, it can be a form of bonding, it's a part of bdsm, it's.... ""weird"" and I guess that's what I like. 

But it's not everyone's fetish so I understand haha","wow, thanks for the insight! different strokes for different folks i guess, but i do appreciate you taking the time to give us some insight :)",,,

cq4gc39,"Apple has 5.825 billion outstanding shares valued at 126.67 as of today. This total valuation comes out to ~737 billion dollars of value. According to this balance sheet http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=AAPL+Balance+Sheet&amp;annual 

Apple holds no treasury stock to protect from takeovers. However 60.79% of the stocks outstanding shares are held by institutional investors. Many of these holders may not be willing to sell the stock, due to speculation that it may increase. The investment banks, holdings groups and hedge funds that own the stocks have it wrapped up in mutual funds and index funds that are not actively managed, and could have planned to go long and hold the stock for many years. Say hypothetically that you did have 737 billion dollars and wanted to own 100% of apple. Even buying 2% of the stock, would cause huge spikes in prices due to the increase in volume of the stock being traded. Think about it this way, your desire to purchase the stock is information to people owning the stock. If they think someone wants a ton of it, they believe this person may know something they don't and will not accept the same 126.67 as before. Say that you had trillions of dollars however, theoretically you could find a price that every stockholder would sell it at, however this would likely be way above what the stock was actually worth. Although the management and board of directors of the company would likely do things to try to prevent a takeover of 100% of the firm.","Thanks a lot for your very in-depth answer! i have one more question, what kind of measures would the management and BoD take to prevent an eventual total takeover?",,,

These are the incredibly beautiful lyrics from Van Morrison's song, [Astral Weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ech6pZoBJ4).  I remember once upon a time I felt this way about a woman.  A woman that was very special to me.  I simply can't ever imagine feeling like that again, given the complete realisation of the reality of it all.   

As I listen to poet-artists like Van Morrison, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Yo La Tengo, Beach House, and other such geniuses; I can't help but wonder, ... with lyrics so poignant, heartfelt, and vulnerable, isn’t it completely impossible this sort of sentiment could ever exist in reality? What I mean is,   given the unfortunate nature of women, primarily hypergamy (but all of the other negative qualities too), being in love in such a poignant, vulnerable way is ultimately foolish and unrealistic.  And yet, I can recall feeling like it was the most incredible magical world.   Colors were brighter.   I felt like the lyrics and music were written for me, and they painted my world and made my soul sing. A truly blissful illusion.   

Does that sound beta?  Probably.   But   I simply cannot forget the years I was with this woman and the music and poetry we'd share - how *real* it felt.  Spoiler alert: She ended up treating me like shit  leaving me when I lost my job, completely deleting my perception of how deep and transcendent the 'love' was. I showed a moment of weakness and hardship, and she was gone in an instant.

I read the poetry of Pabldo Neruda or the letters Vladimir Nabakov wrote to his wife (*“Yes, I need you, my fairy-tale. Because you are the only person I can talk with about the shade of a cloud, about the song of a thought — and about how, when I went out to work today and looked a tall sunflower in the face, it smiled at me with all of its seeds.”*) and I can’t help but feel so depressed that it’s all just an illusion. I thought it was real for so long; the highest thing to aspire to, a genuine love. 

Are these poets and musicians just ‘blue pill beta males’ in the eyes of the TRP community?  Where does this sort of heartfelt sentiment fall under this framework?   It just saddens me.  I feel freed because I think I’ve found the truth, that it was just an illusion. But just the same, it makes me depressed beyond belief.

Edit: I agree that there are much bigger problems in the world than this, and I know people will do what they want, and I'm not going to change that. The thing I was trying to convey is that, /r/trees as a whole should not be promoting this type of thing.

cis22qz,"I think the core of the ""Women are essentially children; you cannot reason with them"" idea isn't that they are LITERALLY children, but rather that to a man, the way to reason with them is similar. This is not to say that they are mentally underdeveloped or incapable. The audience for this statement is men, and it is actually an extremely powerful, pursuasive and eye-opening statement to a man.

You see, men have a way of reasoning with each other. When we argue intellectually, we COMPLETELY remove ourselves from the equation and there is no subcontext to the ideas. Personal attacks are breaking the rules. Appeals to each other's authority are unjust and fallacious. Appeasing each other goes contrary to the concept of arguing. All of this gets in the way of the subject at hand. When a bunch of guys, tasked with finding a place to go to lunch, begin talking, some will say ""I don't care.. anything is fine"" and almost always THEY MEAN IT. Others will have dietary restrictions. Some may not want to walk long distances. All the variables are put on the table, and a short list of options of maximal utility obvious to everyone is made, and if there is not a clear choice, then the alpha male of the group is the tie breaker. There is no hard feelings, even by the vegan who ends up at the steak house for lunch because he can clearly see that it was the most obvious compromise for the good of the group. Once the decision has been made and execution has begun, then there is a complete focus on accomplishing the task and no one questions it anymore; the vote has been taken and it's over.

That's not how women work. Given the lunch situation, they reason through competitiveness, appeals for sympathy, etc.. Once the decision has been made, the losers will still attempt to sabotage the group to get their way. It's a much more competitive environment. This is also the way young boys act. Men understand this; men have lived and competed in this very same environment and we know the rules. The thing is, we expect that at a certain age that others ""became adults"" which means we now reason more democratically backed by a dictitorial rule of the alpha male. When we deal with children, we know that they are ""not adults"" and so we strongly project our leadership to force a dictatorship on the group of children, only allowing the democratic reasoning amongst the other adults in the group to the exclusion of the children.

When we say ""women are like children"" we mean that they don't even comprehend the rules of the debate process. Many of us have a tendency to think, ""Well, she's over 16, she should be included in the debate"". The problem is, we now have a self interested, non-democratic force that we have given the vote to. This force is subversive and undermines the male reasoning process, and makes it difficult to achieve finality in the decision when done by our rules. It also makes us look weak because we aren't acting with self interest in a democracy, we are acting with group interest which means we are giving the group permission to screw us over as an individual, which destroys our credibility to the women who see this as a severe competitive disadvantage, because it is!  The easiest way to get a man to understand why he is losing his frame is to pin it to an analogy that he is familiar with: Women reason the way you used to reason as a child. If you go in with that mindset, suddenly the rules of the game make total sense!

This is not to say that women's reasoning is inferior because it is more akin to the childlike reasoning of young boys. It's just different. It serves a different purpose. Women are biologically more valuable. They need to continue to exist for the offspring to be taken care of, so their reasoning faculties are naturally more self interested in order to secure their own preservation. Men need to ensure the survival of the group, because after 45 seconds, my genes are implanted and my personal job is done... now I need to ensure that the tribe lives long enough and prosperous enough for that seed I planted to grow long enough to pass on my genes. Our reasoning stems from the idea of self sacrifice for the greater good of the group, and by sacrifice I don't just mean working your ass off to make sure dinner is ready, I mean *SACRIFICE* as in if it means my tribe will do better if I take a mammoth tusk to the face, then that's what I'm going to do today. ""Childlike reasoning"" is not inferior, because it means that the women and children have a better chance of individual survival, which is THE WHOLE POINT.

TLDR; Women reason like children. That's not demeaning women, in fact it's a damn good strategy and far superior to male reasoning for the position they hold. Pointing this out is not intended to insult the mental development of the woman, but rather to help men understand where they are coming from. If children reasoned like men in a harsh environment then many would not survive to breeding age and that would suck. If women reasoned like men in a harsh environment, then many children would not survive to breeding age, which would suck.

Your entire tirade against the LGTB community. You hate it, with no reason to. Let me illustrate:

&gt;Being LGBT goes against evolution. Humans ""evolved"" to not be LGBT. It's the very act of reproduction that we have genitals to have sex with and procreate.

Absolutely false. Humans evolve to whatever condition suits them. If LGBTs exist, it's because they have survived, and there's no reason to say they're ""wrong."" How can you say evolution goes against them *when they exist*? It's only because you hate them.

&gt;Now I myself don't condone same sex intercourse and the like but i've recently have come to accept LGBT and realize that it's THEIR lives not mine.

Fuck you. That's like saying ""I don't like black people, but I'm okay with the fact that they exist because it's their life, not mine."" Again, fuck you. You are evil.

&gt;Yes, God is mysterious and there is so much more to learn about him than we could possibly imagine

Fantastic, the ""God of the Gaps"" fallacy! Whatever you want god to be gives you reason to hate other people! Fuck you.

&gt;the whole reason for gays being condemned by the church is that sex was created for us to reproduce! You won't see any gay people reproducing and having a child.

FUCK YOU.

&gt;So yes being gay IS wrong.

I got shouted at by a blind person I offered to help cross a busy road with a traffic light that had no audible cues for visually impaired people.

I got shouted at for offering to help a man in a wheelchair get over the curb onto the sidewalk, which he had been trying to do for 5 minutes. 

I got insulted by several visually impaired people, old people, pregnant women, people with walking disabilities and so forth for offering them my seat on the bus, tram or train.

[This blog has really good swatches of every shade there is](http://xoxovalentinekissesxoxo.blogspot.com/2013/09/jordana-twist-shine-moisturizing-balm.html), so hopefully you'll see a few colors that interest you.

Here's my only big requirement from people entering: I want to see a picture of your most treasured possession.  The zombie apocalypse has begun and will reach your city any day now.  There are lots of things you want to take with you as you flee to a safer area, but the car is so loaded up with shotguns and canned goods that you can only take one special, precious item with you.  WHAT DO YOU TAKE? 

OTHER REQUIREMENTS:

1. Please be in the US or Canada (sorry international friends!)
2. Please have joined this sub before this post was made
3. Include the raffle word ""zombiesinlipstick""

The contest will end a week from now, Sunday January 12th at midnight US Central Time.  The 7 winners will be announced on Monday, and then I'll go out shopping for everybody.  Good luck!","Id bring my kitten [Leo] (http://imgur.com/D5TxccH). Even if he might get lost in the end because he is very curious, Id want to cuddle him while we flee to a safer area. 
For the balm stain I like: Sweet Pink, Cranberry Crush or Rock N Rouge.

db14p50,"I am not sure if others saw it, wrote about it, but if they did the developers clearly didn't pay attention to it. The problem is is that if you complete two or more quests at once you get gems only for one. This happened to me first time with 3 quests, win 2 multiplayer games, play 3 mushrooms, and win with a smarty hero, I was at 1 multiplayer win and after winning a multiplayer match with Green Shadow(a smarty hero) I got all quests done and TADAAAM only 10 gems gained instead of 30, but that was barely anything so I didn't bother. But this time I couldn't simply stay silent, I had a quest do 300 damage to enemy heroes which costs 100 gems and a quest play 3 imps for 10 gems, I have been doing the first one for a couple of days and got the imp quest just today, finished simultaneously waiting for my gems to go from 1126 to 1236 and guess what happens? That's right, my gems go to 1136, instead of giving me my rightful 110 gems or at least 100 gems they gave me 10 gems, I personally think that is a big ripoff and I am very disappointed. Please fix as soon as possible, I hope this isn't intended and is a bug and will hopefully be fixed soon, for now I am forced to not do any quests since I know I will lose gems.","Sometimes it happens,  just restart the game.

I figured this question would be a good way to get people to express how they really felt, but I had no idea there would be so many depressing posts! Now here I am feeling sad and kind of down, but that's ok. I'm reading every post as they come in and glad that everyone is being genuine and expressing how they feel. Though every post is not uplifting, I enjoy reading them. So please keep them coming!!

Update 1: I'm having trouble now keeping up with all these comments!!! This is awesome. I'm glad people are letting all of there feelings out. And since I can't answer everyone, I'm sorry to all of those who are going through hard times. I don't know what you are going through or how you feel, and I never know the right things to say, but there are people who do! Everyone is here to help and we all really hope to bring some sort of joy into your lives. We all care so please share your feelings. And to those who are happy, spread the happiness!! It feels so good when I read comments about good things happening in peoples lives. Thank you all.

Update 2: Thanks for all the wonderful PM's everyone! My original intention when I first started this post was to try and respond to everyone, but now that's just impossible. I guess that's what every other redditor is for! I'm glad everyone is able to connect here, share positive feelings, offer words of advice, give thanks, help those that are feeling down and maybe help someone feel just a little bit happier. It really is an awesome feeling to see everyone getting involved.

And to those asking how I am doing (thanks for asking by the way), honestly I'm just ok. I've been stressed out a bit and my life right now is sort of at a pause while I await many answers. Today I was mad because I was screwed out of some money and now I'm $200 in the hole. That got me feeling down, but I was ok a little later. It's a lot of money, but I figured it's only money and there's no point in crying over something I can't get back. That's when the idea to submit this askreddit came up. We are always asked ""How are you?"" by someone many times throughout a day, but how often do we give an honest answer and really mean it when we say, ""Oh, I'm good"" or ""I'm fine."" I figured we probably rarely mean it and decided this post would be a good place to just let it all out. Please continue to post and don't let anything stop you. Someone somewhere in the world will read it!","I'm 17. The last girl I did stuff with was slightly drunk, and not to mention already in a relationship, when I felt her up and kissed her.

dljjhlv,"It's these kinds of stories and the replies it normally generates from people that honestly make me lose sooooo much faith in gay men and their ability to have legitimate and committed relationships.

So many gay guys are just so used to always seeing men through a lustful lens that eventually at some point they will cave into those desires and want to have sex with someone else, regardless of if they actually feel in love with you or not.

It's like monogamy and commitment are just ""phases"" rather than an intentional goal.

I guess the only positive thing I can take from this is that he at least had the decency to ask and talk about it rather than just cheat on you.

Still this personally for me would be so disheartening and would make me feel like all the things that I offer will never be enough.
That I would be just a great convenience for him to come home to but beyond that, his desires for others will be greater than his love for me.

Again though that's just me and I still stand by that at the end of the day to each their own.

c4tsv5g,"Well, see, the thing is: I was at a Cafe earlier. And I was stoning outside, with the two staff members who had the shit. I didn't realize it had opium in it, only after I described it to my friend he told me it had opium in it.


Well, anyway, ONTO the point: Some of my friends' friends were there. A friend of my friend's like do you have stuff? I'm like yeah. We go outside, we go to the adjacent (stoner) building and these two staff members of the cafe already have some shit. I smoked their joints, I flew aaway. Literally, I had a trip, couldn't see, couldn't... well, anything. Yes, and then the staff members made two joints outta MY hash and then I gave them to my friend and this other friend of his. He's like gimme some man, and then Fuck, he took the hole packet

and he's like

I'll give it back to you man

or I'll score some for you

and shit

all the while, I was high out of my mind. (I'm still pissed off, he took My hash, no more late night lonely stoning till I get more, should I hit him up to get it back?)

So, basically, I kinda got drugged. The opium in the joint they offered me was VERY fucking strong. Like an out-of-body experience, Couldn't see, it was like... All closing down on me, my vision went really red and shit. Like damn, and I should mention I'm 16. well, anyway I'm just venting. Can you help me and tell me what the thing was, the thing that was mixed in their hash.

I live in Karachi, google the country, and the same friend who said it was hash is like half of karachi's hash has opium in it and you have to steer away from the bad shit.

So was it hash only, or opium-hash shit? and Yes, I shouldn't smoke with strangers, but we all knew each other here(being regulars at the cafe). God, damn.","Dont fucks with hash anymore. Trust me, you'll be straight. Just dont go into heroin, thats some horrible shit.",,,

d5u7m4d,"WOW, there's a lot of really bad answers here with completely false info, especially /u/TRENZAL0RE 's answer.

1) A lot of people out there are idiots and don't understand terminology or advice given to them. Some people equate WiFi with any non cellular access. To these people saying don't use a public computer is exactly the same as don't use public WiFi. The real message is DON'T USE PUBLIC COMPUTERS to access your bank account. These computers can be compromised with key loggers, etc...

here's how an actual attack on wifi might go down:

2) a) The issue with using public WiFi hotspots is not necessarily with the provider but also with the users connected to the hotspots. When you connect to a wifi access point you are then assigned an IP address and routing/DNS info from the DHCP server which is usually a service running on the router. However, ANYONE can run a DHCP service on their computer (or even their rooted phone) and use that to assign a chosen DNS server. So either the provider, or if a user is running a DHCP service that user (assuming your device gets its IP designation from their competing DHCP service, a 50/50 chance) will have control of what DNS service you are using. The DNS is used to resolve the domain to an IP. So an attacker will run a custom DNS that will resolve a chosen domain to whatever computer they wish (i.e. their own). So this is the first part of an attack, routing your access to a target machine of their choice. It's not even 100% necessary for a user to use a custom DHCP server, if the router is badly secured they could simply replace the DNS settings on the router with one of their choice.

2) b) When you type an address into your browser address bar, for some stupid reason, it will prioritises insecure http over secure https when attempting to connect to the server. So if you type in www.mybank.com it is actually going to try and visit http://www.mybank.com which is not secure. and typical bank will redirect that to the secure page https://www.mybank.com, but since an attacker has control of the DNS its now the server so it can redirect a site to whatever the fuck it wishes, like https://www.notmybank.com or https://www.mybank.attackersdomain.com. Since the attacker owns the domains notmybank.com and attackersdomain.com it can easily get reliable certificates for both of those domains with ease and the user will see that lovely green secure symbol in the address bay to say that a valid cert has been provided and sees a page written by the attacker that looks like their bank page because the attacker just ripped the html from the actual page.

a lot of people on this post are talking about MITM attacks or cookie hijacking on the https connection (what i described above is kind of a MITM attack, but not of the sort others are describing). These attacks are all BS for secure connections. You would have to be able to spoof the cert which is almost impossible (there have been a number of cases where people have gotten legitimate certs for high profile domains, such as microsoft.com subdomains using social engineering). And cookies are part of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol not SSL/TLS so they are not sent insecurely when you are on a secure connection.

I'm slightly drunk, but if anyone wants to go through an attack scenario I will happily debunk/approve it as a possible attack vector.",I came here just to make sure this answer was here.,,,

drm7h9q,"Ayyyyyy, I'm not the only one. Talking about being Muslim usually gets a lot of backlash of ""what about logic?""

To someone who has spent time with the religious texts and ideas, they will find that there is no part of the religion anywhere that defies logic. Everything fits beautifully. And if it's hard for you to see that, you're not understanding the teachings correctly.

The beautiful thing about Islam is that it's not just a set of beliefs, it's a way of life. It has answers to all of life's questions. 

As someone who is always asking questions and looking for answers and trying to understand for myself the true meaning of life, this is very helpful for me.

I believe that everything in life can be boiled down to a formula. Everything is created and functions within certain parameters. I can't, myself, with my limited brain and knowledge, figure out the formula myself, no matter how much I've tried to venture out and think of new ways of understanding this big picture and fit all the puzzle pieces perfectly. No matter how much of my own personal arguments I make, the structure always falls. 

So why should I attempt to create my own worldview from scratch when I can take a worldview that already has the formula written out (it's a really complicated formula). And the formula doesn't break. It makes sense. There's an answer for everything. The structure doesn't fall.

A lot of people in this thread are saying that thinking types have the most problem with religion. I find that a lot of other ideologies break when questioned with logic. Or can't apply to everything. ","Omg yes! The science and maths and so many other things about Islam, I can't explain. ",,,
c3qaa8m,"I've been an r/trees lurker for quite some time now. I may not be an ent myself, but my best friend has been one for the past 3 years, so I understand the humor and can comprehend the how awesome everything is. I've been with my friend and his older brother when they were toking on numerous occasions, so I'm not a complete noob. 

The only reason I've never toked myself, was due to the fear of drug tests and what my other group of friends would think of me. Well this year my school stopped drug testing due to a lack of funds and unbeknownst to me my entire friend group became ents last year. They all get together on a saturday, toke and chill. In fact they went to the Midnight premiere of the 3-D version of Star wars Episode 1 blazed. 

Anyways, now that there's nothing in my way I'm starting to think about doing it. It looks like a hell of a lot of fun. 

So I came to the mothership to ask for guidance.
Currently I'm 17 and a junior in High school, therefore buying a piece from a headshop is out of the question. ( My friend and I tried last week at two different stores)

I'm thinking of buying from an online website like http://www.gogopipes.com/ and ordering it the week my dad leaves for India. (Business) He's leaving sometime in march. 
I know how to make a pipe/bong out of a water bottle, but I'd much rather have a glass pipe.

As far as getting bud is concerned I won't have a problem. Not only do my friends have connections, but I used to talk about weed with some upperclassman last year and if I ask, they'll oblige. 


My biggest question really is what and where to buy.
As it is I have no clue where to buy a piece. (Due to my age of course)

I have a little checklist so far

-Pipe
-Grinder
-Bubbler (Possibly)
-Lighter 
-Glass jar for my stash
-and quite possibly a smokebuddy.

If you guys could give me any advice on how to get started, what i'll really need and maybe advice as to what kind of piece I should buy, that'd be awesome!

Thanks r/trees!

","It may be because i live in canada, but I'm 14 and I could put bongs anywhere and no one cares, also just ask your friend for the number to their dealer. 
Always buy a pipe first, grinders don't even matter, and just regular lights  or use your friends equipment.

People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own Soul.

Ok, so I (18F) have lived next door to my neighbors for 10 years now. Their youngest son is a few months older than me, so growing up we were good friends. At first, being 8 years old I thought boys were icky and didnt ever think of dating him (we'll call him N). 

As we got older I developed a crush on him and being that we always hung out, we were very comfortable around each other. Our families have met and get along great. Over the years, N and I had our fights and awesome memories but our flirting never came forward between us. It just sort of happened. Like we were both afraid to say something that might ruin our good friendship. 

By freshman year I decided to tell him how I felt. I made the mistake of saying I HAD liked him. And he responded saying that he HAD liked me too. After a while I was confused about his answer but I never asked him and nothing ever came up after. Throughtout high school, N never had a gf and I, while never being one to be asked out anyway, always avoided crushing on guys because I felt so close with N that I didn't want to even think of being with someone else. 

Fast forward to this last summer. We graduated, N got a part time job at a restaurant, I had my job shaving ice in a farmers market booth and life was easy. N had always wanted to be a firefighter growing up, so he enrolled and was accepted into the fire academy, starting in late July. Now, with this deadline, I knew something had to be done before he got crazy busy with work and school. 

Still, I wanted to make sure he felt the same way. Rejection terrifies me. So I figured I'd be with him as much as possible over the summer and then ask before the academy started. 

So, we went swimming a lot, watched movies at night, and watched youtubers we liked. When we were inside, we were usually in his room on the bed. We kind of cuddled (our legs intertwined and were over one another) which I loved. He would even lay in the middle of the bed so no matter what I'd have to be close to him. 

At first, on days he worked 5-9 at night, he would say he didn't wanna hang out before that. Then one day, as I was leaving his house, I said ""Ill see you on (whatever day)!"" Knowing the next day he worked in the evening. He replied ""Well why not tomorrow?"" I knew right then that he was liking me too. 

Before I wrap this up, let me say this: N ALWAYS acted different around me then with his friends at school. Like we wouldn't talk at all at school but come home and hangout. If we saw each other at school he would just wave or make a goofy face. One of his lady friends, K, was around him a lot. They've been friends through at least high school, maybe junior high. So, my point is, I don't think she knows him like I do considering he acts different around us. The way he acts with me it feels like it's his true self. 

Ok, so my prediction was right: he got super busy once the academy started and I saw him probably 3 times throughout the 5 and a half months. In early November, his older sister got married. I was excited to go, but mostly so N would see me wearing a dress and fancy makeup. When we arrived I saw him holding hands with a girl, but not any girl, it was K! I felt crushed but didn't want him to see it. 

(I guess I know why he never made an effort to hangout now) 

I felt sick throughout the entire wedding. I feel happy for him, but DAMN I wish it was me. Now that he knows that I know he has a gf, he won't respond to my texts of wanting to hang out, or even just play xbox. He always seems gone so I have no chance to get one on one time with him. 

K is actually kinda my friend as well. She's nice and super Christian, so she's a good girl but I know N and he is not as religious as he says. 
And I am NOT one of those girls to try and break people up. 

Anyways, I feel torn. Do I tell him I still like him? Then he'll probably never even talk to me. And I really feel that it would be perfect to be in a relationship with someone you grew up with, know very well, and have been comfortable around their family for years. I kinda feel like his mom likes me better lol.

Any feedback is appreciated. I'm happy to finally share this with someone. Getting it off my chest helps, if nothing else will. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: Childhood longtime crush got a gf after we almost got together. ","Why didn't you ask him before he went to the academy, like you planned?

At this point I'd say, leave them alone. Go no contact. If they don't work out maybe someday you'll get another chance, or maybe not who knows.  Either way, now is not your time.",,,

dgobrje,"Thursday last week, I withdrew money using my BDO debit card from BPI's ATM on the ground floor of the Link Carpark in Makati.

I hardly use this card for any transaction since it's  associated with a joint account that I use for savings. Thursday was the only time I used it in the past 60 days therefore suspected that it was skimmed when I discovered yesterday that my account was debited significant amounts of money. I called BDO and was told that the transactions were cash withdrawals from an ATM in Milano, Italy.

So beware. Do not use the aforememtined ATM lest you risk your card potentially getting skimmed. Be careful, everyone!

cp2a9zj,"Last saturday I awoke early for that day was a blessed day to worship and pray in the iron temple.  A friend who had spoken much of working out for his weight lifting class at a local college told me of his desire to worship with me.

Brothers I was most overjoyed; however, I had warned him several times never to use....machines before hand.  He had been using the squat, and bench machines at his college gym.  He boasted of a 265lb squat and a 165lb bench.

After one look up and down it couldn't be true. For I had started far before him and was not even close to hitting such a squat in the 5x5 mantra.  Hath Brodin shown favor to my close friend who is pure blood of the shadow man clan?  Was I being punished by Brodin for merely being born a cursed and forsaken....mulatto?

When we arrived in the house of worship, we came upon the swoly power rack and after relaxed warm up prayers, I went to break my plateau the blasted 185 that hath plagued me for so long.  After the first set he cried out ""put on the 2nd 45lb plate for me.  I want to show you that I can do this.""  I replied with kindness and patience saying, ""I really don't think it's a good idea.  I've never gone past this weight.  It could be dangerous."" for I had seen his form and after seeing such poor posture I feared that failure would damn him to a wheelchair and forever frailty.  He insisted.  I put the weights on the rack with deep regret in my heart.  He got under the weight unracked with great fervor, but in his eyes was great fear as he descended and realized that he couldn't stop the weight. Brodin be praised for the sides of the power rack allowed him to let the weight go.  As he crawled from under the Swoly Barbell, many men were smirking as they trotted by.  Giggling at him.  He looked up at me with the eyes of a puppy.  I spoke not a word of it.  We continued until half way through the workout when he declared that he had other things he had to do on this day.  Other things planned.  I continued and finished the rest of the workout alone.

1 Swolinthians Set 6: Reps 9-11 For do you not know that only the workers of Broki will not inherit the kingdom of Brodin?  Do not be deceived: Neither the cardio enducer, nor the runner, nor the boaster, nor the swolester, nor the men who practice horizontal cardio with other men, nor the lazy, nor the weak willed, nor the machine user, nor the crossfitter shall inherit the kingdom of Brodin.

cxy11vy,"Today started like any day. Woke, ate some food, hopped on my computer to play a game or two quick before I went off to work. Then it changed drastically... I received a call from a friend that *never* calls me. Looked at my phone and said, ""Why the hell are they calling me?"" and picked it up. I was greeted by them and were obviously distressed. She asked me if anyone had talked to me about my best friend, who we can call 'Bill'. I said hadn't heard anything and asked why was she asking; then my world changed.

'Bill' and I have been friends for years. We met in college orientation and stayed friends all the way through college. We were essentially the same person, except I look like a stoner nerd and he looked like a fucking viking before he cut his hair. We got a long *so* very well and we knew more things about each other than our parents probably did. 

However, that phone call? It was to inform me that 'Bill' had died last night. He has been struggling with mental illnesses and depression for a while, and in the end, he took his own life.

One way I grieve is to remember the good things. I remember all the things about him and things we did and wanted to do, what we talked about, who we talked about, what in life ground our gears that day.

This led to a simple question for myself: How do *I* want to be remembered?

I don't mean this in a deep way either. I don't mean being remembered for discovering a cure, or for solving some existential problem. I just mean the memories that I leave with people to remember when my own time to die inevitably comes.

I realized that i want people to remember my laugh, my shitty jokes, my ability to stay unnaturally calm at all times, and that I'm always willing to listen, even though i might just end up telling you how it is, not what you wanted to hear. The comforting part is, I think that that is exactly what people will remember.

Part of the reason I'm writing this is just to get it out, but also because i wanted to hopefully trigger some of you to think about how you wanted to be remembered, and what those things were.
  
  
So, How do you want to be remembered?",I want to be remembered for my terrible puns and my constant rants about everything,,,

I ask what the problem is because I like correcting people.

She says that she's upset because chicken wings are always the most expensive part of the chicken, ""even though they have the least meat on them"".

I explain to her.

""That's why they're the most expensive. It costs more money to make chicken wings than it does to make breasts. It takes one chicken to make two wings, and one chicken to make two breasts, but there's easily 4-5x as much meat (probably more) in a breast than in a wing. To get the same amount of meat as two chicken breasts, you need to raise 6+ chickens. So one package of chicken breasts cost way less to make than one package of chicken wings.""

&gt;That makes no sense.

""Let me make it easier. If it costs 10 dollars to raise a chicken, that means it costs 10 dollars to make a package of two chicken breasts. How many wings come in a package? 10 or more. So that means it requires 5 or more chickens to make a package of chicken wings, meaning it costs 50 dollars versus 10 dollars for the breasts. It costs more to make, so it costs more to sell, so it costs more to buy.""

&gt;That makes no sense. There's less meat so it should cost less.

""I don't know how to explain it any simpler.""

and then she left. No wonder customers bitch all day about prices if they can't comprehend something as simple as ""it costs more to make so it costs more to buy"".

Smoke a lot of dope now (always have, but more frequently now that I don't drink regularly anymore), play a lot of video games, still single. Only 22, I'm not in a rush. ","Wow.... almost the exact timeline of events for me including breakup, drinking, hookups turned friends etc. Not so much the other stuff. Keep the faith, kid. Roommates are the best.",,,

Many of you took an interest in my Stamp Stampede campaign to stamp money out of politics, so I'm here to announce all July, in honor of the birth of the nation, it's ""Pay What You Can"" month at the Stamp Stampede! 

Anyone, anywhere can name their own price for any of the four kinds of stamps sold on the StampStampede.org website, and I just decided to sweeten the pot: 100 people that decide to create a Stampers Pledge video will have a chance to win a free pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream!!!

At the end of July, I'll pick 100 Stampers Pledge video submissions at random and mail everyone a coupon redeemable for a free pint, any flavor.

Go here to create a pledge video for a chance to win &amp; more details of Pay What You Can Month:

The legal drinking age in New Zealand is 18, and I *think* it's 21 in the U.S. (?), so be sure to address that. On top of that, New Zealand has a pretty loose drinking culture, so I'm sure she already knows her way around a bottle of booze.

Don't be surprised if she makes fun of herself a lot of puts herself down. It's not that she has low self esteem, it's just that boasting or 'talking yourself up' is seen as undesirable personality trait in New Zealand, and quite rude.

New Zealand is a reasonably secular society, so there is a very good chance this girl will be an atheist. And by that I don't mean the kind of antagonistic, constantly-attacking-religion type of atheist, but rather someone who simply hasn't been raised into any religion. If you happen to be religious, don't force your beliefs on her in anyway, it will make her feel very uncomfortable.

Although, having said that, everyone is different. She could very well be an anti-alcohol, bible thumper who can't stop telling everyone how awesome she is. You never know.

Also, and this comes from someone who did an overseas exchange many moons ago, don't go out of your way to find New Zealand food/music/TV/whatever. She's had all that since she was born.

dow9lee,"i feel like an idiot for even posting this, but I’ve known I was bi since i was 13/14, but have never dated a girl, or put myself out there. I’ve always been monogamous with boyfriends over the years. I’m 20 now, and to this day have only really hooked up with a couple girls. It was nice, but I want to get to know girls on a deeper level and build that connection first. Even with men, I’ve noticed that if I have a connection with someone (on even a friend level), the sex is just 100x better than if it’s a stranger I’m hooking up with. 
Here’s my issue: I’ve had crushes before on girls, but always from afar - I’ve never had a deep crush that had me head over my heels and in pain when it didn’t work out. But I think the reason is because I just have never dated girls, and most girls think I’m straight. Additionally, girls aren’t my comfort zone. Girls are beautiful and plush and so complex - it’s so much easier to be friends and not get rejected or thought of as “weird” for getting flirty. Any advice for meeting girls and being more open about my sexuality? I’m a pretty extraverted person, very involved, and I’d say have a lot of qualities that could be considered desirable and unique. I’m just kinda scared of the rejection.
PS, I’m still sort of in the closet - there’s no one in my life that wouldn’t support me, I just kinda don’t think anyone believes me. after all, I’m 100% straight passing, have never dated a girl, and know nothing about eating pussy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ","Yeah I feel very similar to alllll this lol.

d5h6k7x,"It's not that the casting is hard in particular or just needs time getting used to(though that does help some). It's that the casting method is a poor choice for a time-sensitive hard CC ground-targeted circle with a delay. You can no longer cast at max range(unless your mouse accuracy is godlike), you can no longer knock people up, but the biggest thing i think messes up the casting for experienced Taliyah players, is the fact that the casting no longer starts when you press W the first time. It's not until you release it. It's like being used to playing with smartcast and now having to use smartcast with indicator. So smartcasting the W is essentially slower than it was before and it messes up the experienced player base who were used to a certain delay. Moreover, I think the ability overall lost potential when in experienced hands. I've tried maybe 10-15 games in an attempt to get used to it, or at the very least have an informed opinion, and I can tell that the new W in particular is inferior to the old one when trying to make clutch plays(flash + proto + max range W, knocking away melees leaping towards you, etc.). Furthermore, the lock-out removal has(maybe unintentionally) changed her identity from control/kite mage more to burst/combo mage(something I almost feel is much worse than the W change), which is why her damage has been nerfed. This is another discussion, however, but I felt it was worth mentioning because I don't think people realize that more nerfs are incoming because her direction has been changed. She will essentially be a worse Viktor/orianna/anivia/syndra/annie since her combo relies on her W and that is not very reliable.",Thanks for explaining it.

Though if nobody is trying to call the park service, local humane shelters and vets looking for them, it more points to dogs that were intentionally left.","Fuck that, even if they did run off from their owners, I wouldn't return them, anyways! Look at the shape they are in. I could never, in good conscience, give them back.",,,
ceyfp2h, This is my first time over here. Is there like a guide you guys follow? I've been trying to break the habit for years now and I'm so tired of it. I want it out of my life. It makes me depressed. The longest streak I've had is like a week. I feel so good when i avoid it but I always manage to come right back and it makes me feel like crap. Why is it so hard??,"I've tried it without this sub too, and it is infinitely easier with it. I don't even know why. It could be because last time I really tried I was 16 and now I'm 19. But being able to read other people's struggles and whatever else is just nice.",,,

crbnygs,"I'm a Mormon on his way out with his wife and 2 kids.  We're young but looking for a community or some friends to hang out with who kind of have the same situation.  Let me know... we are south of Lethbridge ab, not really wanting to give too much Info because the Mormon World is small and for now we are trying not to yell from the roof tops.  We actually kinda just want to leave it alone, not wanting to damage relationships with family, yet.  Well maybe start a Podcast! Ha... not so much. 
Anyways, I say these things in the name of Kate Kelly!
","I'm 30 and my wife is 25, I work in Cardston seasonally, Lethbridge the other halve of the year.  ",,,
dp9eale,"Honest question- how does this show give any viewer an emotional or rewarding rise anymore?  I watch it on fast forward now and don’t feel like I’ve missed anything.

A show about constant survival with no discernible plot points gets exhausting.  Negan = The Governor = any other human threat on this series.

Bland, useless, unoriginal storytelling and has been for the last 2-3 yrs.","You're 100%, give the show a decent ending and be done with it. It's turned into a bad imitation of what it was, now it's simply a CSI money spinning clone. You know a show has gone too long when you stop caring when it's season begins, kind of want Rick to die now, his accent lately and his constant Independence Day type speeches are past boring. End it on a bang, or watch it turn into the Simpsons (as in irrelevant).
